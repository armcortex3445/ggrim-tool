    "description": "One of the most iconic and recognizable paintings in the world is the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] (ca. 1503-1519) painted by Leonardo da Vinci. The unique appeal of the portrait lies in its enigmatic nature, Mona Lisa’s smile radiates mystery, sensuality and contentment. This was achieved through sfumato, Leonardo’s painting technique that softened the transition between colors. This depth and complexity of expression is the reason the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] is regarded as the pinnacle of portraiture. The interest in the portrait was further amplified by its mysterious history: the identity of the sitter, who commissioned the painting, how long Leonardo worked on the portrait and how it entered the French royal collection are all topics of scholarly debate. \n\nIt is thought that the sitter was Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo. For this reason, the painting is sometimes called [i]La Gioconda[/i]. The earliest identification of the painting was provided by the Renaissance art historian [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari]Giorgio Vasari[/url]. In Vasari’s 1550 biography of Leonardo, he wrote about the magnificent portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, which Leonardo worked on between 1503 and 1506. Many were skeptical of Vasari’s account; however, a 2005 discovery at the University of Heidelberg provided compelling new evidence that confirms Vasari’s assertion. In a volume written by the ancient philosopher Cicero from 1477, there was a handwritten marginal by Leonardo’s contemporary, the secretary and assistant to Niccolò Machiavelli, Agostino Vespucci. In the note dated October 1503, Vespucci praises Leonardo’s skill by comparing him to the Greek and painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/apelles]Apelles[/url], and states that Leonardo is working on a portrait of Lisa del Giacondo.\n\nThe [i]Mona Lisa[/i] was the earliest example in Italian portraiture that portrayed the sitter in a half-length format. Leonardo presented a new artistic formula: the figure is shown at half-length sitting in armchair in front of a [i]loggia[/i] - a gallery or room with one or more open sides. The incorporation of the [i]loggia[/i] allowed Leonardo to present an imaginary landscape as the backdrop of the portrait. This significant innovation influenced Leonardo contemporaries: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url] adopted the composition and pose in his portrait [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/portrait-of-a-lady-with-a-unicorn-1506][i]Young Woman with Unicorn[/i][/url] (ca. 1506). Still it is important to note that Leonardo was indebted to Flemish portraiture of the second half of the 15th century, particularly the portraits of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling]Hans Memling[/url] such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/barbara-de-vlaenderberch-1475][i]Portrait of Barbara van Vlaendenbergh[/i][/url] (ca. 1470-1472) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/portrait-of-a-man-holding-a-coin-of-the-emperor-nero-1474][i]Man with a Roman coin[/i][/url] (ca. 1480).\n\nLeonardo spent his final years in France, where his patron the King of France, Francis I, purchased [i]Mona Lisa[/i] for the royal French collection. From 1797, the portrait is on permanent display at the Louvre and is the crown jewel of the museum collection. On the morning of August 22 1911, Louvre employees were shocked to discover that the painting was stolen the previous night. Two years later, Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia was identified as the thief. Peruggia claimed his motives were patriotic: he believed Leonardo’s masterpiece belonged in Italy and was caught trying to sell the painting in Florence. After its discovery, the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] was exhibited throughout Italy before its celebratory return to the Louvre in 1914.",

    "description": "Van Gogh's night sky is a field of roiling energy. Below the exploding stars, the village is a place of quiet order. Connecting earth and sky is the flamelike cypress, a tree traditionally associated with graveyards and mourning. But death was not ominous for van Gogh. \"Looking at the stars always makes me dream,\" he said, \"Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France? Just as we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star.\"\r\nThe artist wrote of his experience to his brother Theo: \"This morning I saw the country from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big.\" This morning star, or Venus, may be the large white star just left of center in The Starry Night. The hamlet, on the other hand, is invented, and the church spire evokes van Gogh's native land, the Netherlands. The painting, like its daytime companion, The Olive Trees, is rooted in imagination and memory. Leaving behind the Impressionist doctrine of truth to nature in favor of restless feeling and intense color, as in this highly charged picture, van Gogh made his work a touchstone for all subsequent Expressionist painting.",

    "description": "[i]The Birth of Venus[/i], painted by Sandro Botticelli in the 1480s, is one of the most famous paintings in the world: it is a celebrated work of art and the high point of a visit to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. It is also a commercial icon and a line mark of European Art.\n\nThe real subject of the painting and its meaning is a mystery under discussion. Over the centuries, many theories and interpretations have been developed, proving the complexity of this work of art. The composition of the painting is quite simple: in the center, there’s a figure of Venus, goddess of love, standing in a shell being washed up on a beach, blown there by two personifications of winds visible on the left, and welcomed by a maiden on the right. There is a contrast between the title of the work and what it represents: we do not see the moment of Venus’ birth. According to the myth, she was born from the foam of the sea, but the painting shows us the moment when she arrives on land. It is clear that the personifications of the winds are Zephyrus and Aura, one impetuous and the other moderate. But the figure of the girl is uncertain: she could be Spring, a subject dear to Botticelli, because her dress is full of flowers, or the personification of motherhood, or one of the Three Graces. She has branches of roses around her waist, and myrtle branches around her neck - sacred plants for Venus.\n\nThe painting is a masterpiece of linearity and harmonious design, clarity, and brightness of colors, which includes the use of gold in a lot of detail. We have to remember that the painting today is not as glorious it was initially. The colors were brighter, especially the greens of the trees, and the blue of the sky.\n\n[i]The Birth of Venus[/i] is a work of extraordinary innovation, from many points of view. First, it is a representation of a nude woman: this kind of subject was restricted during the Medieval ages - the only exception was an image of Eve in the Garden of Eden. Botticielli produced the image of a beautiful naked woman, with a gaze that is remarkably in direct engagement with the viewer. Next, there is the news of the mythological theme that in the 1480s was absolutely a new type of painting. Botticelli obviously read classical texts before painting it: for example, the Roman writer Plinio made the description of the painting by the Greek artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/apelles]Apelles[/url] that showed Venus rising from the sea or a Homeric hymn that told about Zephyrus that blows his wind on Aphrodite. \n\nBut not only the classical world was the source of Botticelli's work. He depicted the scene with a solemnity that recalls a religious rite; the disposition of the characters and their gestures remind representations of the Baptism of Christ, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrocchio/the-baptism-of-christ]that of Verrocchio[/url], which Botticelli had certainly seen. This iconographic analogy alludes, perhaps, to a thematic analogy between the mythical birth of the goddess from the sea and the Christian birth of the soul from the water of Baptism.\n\nIt is highly probable that the work was commissioned by a member of the Medici family (perhaps by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, a major patron of Botticelli, under the influence of his cousin Lorenzo de' Medici, \"il Magnifico\"), although there is nothing written about the painting before 1550, when [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari]Giorgio Vasari[/url] describes it in the Medici’s Villa of Castello, owned by the cadet branch of the Medici family since the mid-15th century. This hypothesis would seem to be born out by the orange trees in the painting, which are considered an emblem of the Medici dynasty, on account of the assonance between the family name and the name of the orange tree, which at the time was ‘[i]mala medica[/i]’.",

    "description": "Camille, Monet's first wife, is shown with a child in the garden of their house in Argenteuil, near Paris, where they lived between 1872 and 1877. Today, Claude Monet is primarily known as a landscape painter, but in the beginning of his artistic career, he used to concentrate on portraits. No one else appeares in Monet's paintings as often as Camille. In those year, portraits of women were mostly ordered by bourgeois clients, but among progressive painters, the artistic structure became more important than the identity of the portrayed person. The masterly style, the lack of details, and the plainness of the colours led to a completely new directness of expression, independent of the facial gestures of the depicted person. In this picture, the shimmering reds, blues, greens, and white that capture the brilliance of a sun-drenched day are applied with many small brushstrokes, whose varied shapes create the different textures of flowers, grass, and clothing. Meanwhile, the features of the woman are completely indistinct.",

    "description": "This painting is most notable for the disjointment of perspective, as if the two sides of the painting were completed using two different points of view. The right side of the table is not in the same plane as the left side of the table, which was a stylized method used by Cezanne to incorporate the differences of viewpoint into an impressionistic still life. It was this technique that made it possible to bridge the gap between impressionists and cubism, which employed varying perspective and varying angles to depict subjects. As such, this still life is an example of the way in which Cezanne tried to deal with the complexities of visual perception. ",

    "description": "The Luncheon in the Grass, with its depiction of a nude female with fully clothed men was a controversial piece when it was displayed at the Salon de Refuses in 1863. It was considered an affront to the times, not only because of the stark nudity of the woman in contrast to the men but also because Manet used familiar models for the figures in the painting. The nude woman is a combination of both his wife, Suzanne Leenhoff, and one of his other female models, Victorine Meurent. The men, on the other hand, are his brother, Eugene Manet, and his brother in law, Ferdinand Leenhoff. It was also considered controversial because it illustrated the rampant prostitution in Paris at the time, which was a taboo subject just to mention, much less display in an oversized canvas. ",

    "description": "'Zodiac' was Mucha's first work under his contract with the printer Champenois and was originally designed as an in-house calendar for the company. In this composition, Mucha incorporated twelve zodiac signs in the halo-like disk behind the woman's head, one of Mucha's customary motifs. The majestic beauty of the woman is emphasised by her regal bearing and elaborate jewellery.\r\n\r\nThe striking design of the 'Zodiac' calendar quickly attracted the attention of Léon Deschamps, chief editor of 'La Plume'; he bought the rights to distribute it as the magazine's calendar for 1897. It became one of Mucha's most popular designs; at least nine variants of this lithograph are known, including this one which was printed without text to serve as a decorative panel.",

    "description": "By far the best known and most ambitious work, The Garden of Earthly Delights illustrates Bosch’s individual artistic style, containing the most vivid imagery and complexity of symbolic meaning. The triptych is generally thought to be a warning of the dangers of giving in to temptation, but has been subject to vast amounts of conjecture and scrutiny, and critics and historians are split in two directions. Whereas some believe that the middle panel, which depicts a fantastical world of nudes in sexual engagement, large fruits, and other suggestive elements, is simply an illustration of paradise lost, others believe that it is a moral warning, which will lead you to hell, as it is depicted in the third panel of the series. Although there are many contradictory explanations, it is generally thought to be a warning against lust, one of the seven deadly sins. ",

    "description": "This painting, which took three years to complete, was commissioned by the wealthy industrialist Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, who made his money in the sugar industry. Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer favored the arts, especially Klimt, and commissioned him to complete another portrait of his wife Adele in 1912. Adele Bloch-Bauer was the only person to be painted twice by Klimt. This painting is perhaps most famous not for its artistic quality, but because of its scandalous history since inception. Upon her death, Adele Bloch-Bauer wished the painting to be given to the Austrian State Gallery, but it was seized by advancing German forces in World War II. In 1945, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer designated the paintings to be the property of his nephew and nieces, including Maria Altmann. Nonetheless, the Austrian government retained ownership of the painting, and was not returned to the Altmann family until 2006 after a long court battle. The painting was then sold at auction for $135 million dollars, which at that time was the highest price paid at auction for a painting. It is now displayed the Neue Art Gallery in New York. ",

    "description": "One of Mondrian’s earliest paintings, this was the first in which he implemented his color palette of red, blue and yellow, the three primary colors. Also as one of his earlier paintings, it was still a clearly representational form of a tree. As a budding artist, Mondrian began painting simple pastoral landscapes of his home country, and these paintings evolved from those beginning artistic ideas. In the abstraction of the color of the tree and the simple design, Mondrian’s aesthetic style is already present in this simple landscape. This post-impressionistic piece was only a stepping stone in the artist’s development into his ideal form of neo-plasticism.  ",

He became exhausted during the months of studying he went through in preparation for this painting, and decided to go for a walk. His assistant at the time, Gabrielle Munter, who was tidying up the studio in the artist’s absence, inadvertently turned the canvas on its side. Upon Kandinsky’s return, he saw the canvas, fell to his knees and began weeping at the beauty of the painting. His newly found perspective on the piece would change his artistic vision and direction for the rest of his life. ",

    "description": "Typical of Freud's early period, Girl with a White Dog was created using a sable brush, which he used to apply the paint with linear precision, almost like a drawing. The subtle shading evokes a host of textures exuding softness, warmth, and the absence of immediate tension. The robe has slipped off the sitter's shoulder, exposing her right breast. Coupled with the absent stare of the woman and the dog, the muted colors and faint contours give this composition an overall flatness.\n\nThe sitter is Kitty Garman, Freud's first wife, and a noted beauty whose father was artist Jacob Epstein. The dog was one of two bull terriers they were given as a wedding gift.\n\nFreud painted many portraits of Kitty during their brief marriage, which ended in divorce in 1952, due to his chronic infidelities. A weariness in the sitter's expression, the deep hollows under her eyes and the self-supporting gesture of the hand under the left breast hint at her discontent, despite this moment of calm. The analytic distance that came to characterize Freud's brilliance as an observer is reinforced by the absence of a name in the title, despite his intimate connection to the subjects. He was able to see certain things better because he remained aloof.",

    "description": "Many of Courbet’s early paintings from the 1840’s are self-portraits, such as this one. As he had yet to truly develop his realistic painting style, many of these self-portraits are Romantic in style, illustrating the smooth lines and perfection of form of the Romantic school of painting. As a method of self-promotion and advertisement, Courbet made an impression with his self-portraits, and used them to find his own artistic style. After this period, Courbet became convinced that painters should illustrate the world around them as they see it and his realistic work in the later 1840’s gained support among younger realist and neo-romantic painters.

    "description": "The Scream is the best known and most frequently reproduced of all Munch’s motifs. With its expressive colours, its flowing lines and striking overall effect, its appeal is universal.\r\n\r\nDespite radical simplification, the landscape in the picture is recognisable as the Kristiania Fjord seen from Ekeberg, with a broad view over the fjord, the town and the hills beyond. In the background to the left, at the end of the path with the balustrade that cuts diagonally across the picture, we see two strolling figures, often regarded as two friends whom Munch mentions in notes relating to the picture. But the figure in the foreground is the first to capture the viewer’s attention. Its hands are held to its head and its mouth is wide open in a silent scream, which is amplified by the undulating movement running through the surrounding landscape. The figure is ambiguous and it is hard to say whether it is a man or a woman, young or old – or even if it is human at all.\r\n\r\nAs with many of Munch’s pictures, it is assumed that here as well his starting point was private feelings and experience. His diaries contain several remarks that seem to form a background to this depiction of existential angst, among them the following: “I was walking along the road with two friends – Then the sun went down – The sky suddenly turned to blood and I felt a great scream in nature –”.\r\n\r\nThe Scream was first exhibited at Munch’s solo exhibition in Berlin in 1893. It was a central element in “The Frieze of Life”, and has been the theme of probing analysis and many suggested interpretations. The painting also exists in a later version, which is in the possession of the Munch Museum. In addition Munch worked with the motif in drawings, pastels and prints.\r\n",

    "description": "Having failed on two occasions to win the Prix de Rome (1848 and 1849), Bouguereau was hungry for revenge. His early submissions to the Salon reveal this fierce desire to succeed. After his ambitious Equality before Death (1849), the young man aimed to create an impression once again. He put forward an even larger painting inspired by Dante whose work was much loved by the Romantics and who captured all its dramatic beauty. This painting was inspired by a short scene from the Inferno, set in the eighth circle of Hell (the circle for falsifiers and counterfeiters), where Dante, accompanied by Virgil, watches a fight between two damned souls: Capocchio, a heretic and alchemist is attacked and bitten on the neck by Gianni Schicchi who had usurped the identity of a dead man in order to fraudulently claim his inheritance.\n\nThe critic and poet Théophile Gautier was very complimentary: \"Gianni Schicchi throws himself at Capocchio, his rival, with a strange fury, and Monsieur Bouguereau depicts magnificently through muscles, nerves, tendons and teeth, the struggle between the two combatants. There is bitterness and strength in this canvas – strength, a rare quality!” In fact, Bouguereau here shows great boldness. He is exploring the aesthetic boundaries: exaggerating the muscle structure to the point of distorting it, exaggerating the poses, contrasting colour and shadows, depicting monstrous figures and groups of damned souls. We are particularly reminded of the sublime visions of Romantic artists like Blake (1757-1827), Füssli (1741-1825), and Lawrence (1769-1830). Everything in this painting underlines the feeling of terribilita and horror: a theme to which Bouguereau would never again return.",

Small blocks of shifting colors float through the background, set in place with a thick black outline, evincing the idea of a building or a house. It is also the finest example of Klee’s ability in pointillism and technical ability as an artist. As an artist with great skill with color, he was also a great teacher at color mixing and theory. He wrote his great treatise, a collection of lectures, entitled Writings on Form and Design Theory, which is considered one of the most influential writings in modern art. ",

The image is of two boats, full of Japanese sailors, coming up against the namesake of the print, the Great Wave. The wave looks as if it will swallow the boats whole, and that the boat men are sure to be devoured in the wave. Although it is such a strong image, it is simplistically beautiful, with curling blue waves and white frothy tips, which menacingly curl down into points, like claws ready to scoop the sailors out of the sea.

Whereas some of the idioms have been lost to history, others are still relevant and in use today. Although other artists and authors had produced paintings and books on proverbs, this painting is considered to be the first large-scale rendition of the theme. The proverbs, of which there are over 100, as well as the early titles, are meant to illustrate human stupidity and foolishness. The painting was so popular that Pieter Brueghel the Younger reproduced up to twenty copies of it, many of which included various renditions on the proverbs. ",

Delacroix wrote in a letter to his brother that a bad mood that had been hold of him was lifting due to the painting on which he was embarking (the Liberty painting), and that if he could not fight for his country then at least he would paint for it. The French government bought the painting in 1831, with plans to hang it in the room of the new king Louis-Philippe, but it was soon taken down for its revolutionary content. Lady Liberty was eventually the model for the Statue of Liberty, which was given to the United States 50 years later, and has also been featured on the French banknote. ",

This poster by Mucha was produced to promote the new production which opened on 4 January, 1895.\r\n\r\nMucha portrayed Bernardt as an exotic Byzantine noblewoman wearing a splendid gown and an orchid headdress with a palm branch in her hand. This costume was worn in the last act, the climax of the play, where she joined the Easter procession. Placing her life-size figure on an arched platform, Mucha rendered the beauty and dignity of her personality onstage rather than representing her realistic features or the story.\r\n\r\nDelighted with Mucha's design, Bernhardt continued to use this poster for her American tour in 1896.",

    "description": "In 1894, Klimt was commissioned to paint the ceilings in the University of Vienna’s great hall. The commission included three paintings, Philosophy, Medicine, and Jurisprudence. When Klimt presented them to the university upon completion, they were determined to be pornographic in nature, and filled with “perverted excess.” The university would not display them. Medicine was the second painting in the series, and depicted the river of life, and the continuity of life and death, and had no allusions to medicine or the science of healing. Because of this, he was attacked by critics, who pointed out that Vienna at the time was engaging in major medical advancements, and that the painting did not depict anything about either prevention or cure. In 1945, the paintings were destroyed in Germany by advancing forces, the only remaining portions being a photograph of a portion of Medicine, and certain drawings and preliminary sketches. ",

    "description": "Mondrian also experimented with other art forms before settling on his own neo-plastic form, including post-impressionism, pointillism, and cubism, the latter of which this is an example. This piece contains interlocking blocks, which form together in the shape of a tree. But unlike cubist artists from whom he took his cue, such as Picasso and Georges Braque, Mondrian had yet to merge his artistic style with his spiritual pursuits, and as such this was only one of a few of such cubist experiments. Mondrian still had a few years to go before he would begin to fins his real voice as an artist, although one could argue that his style was ever-changing, culminating in his masterpieces in his later years of life.

    "description": "'The Seasons' was Mucha's first set of decorative panels and it became one of his most popular series. It was so popular that Mucha was asked by Champenois to produce at least two more sets based on the same theme in 1897 and 1900. Designs for a further two sets also exist.\r\n\r\nThe idea of personifying the seasons was nothing new - examples could be found in the works of the Old Masters' as well as in Champenois's other publications. However, Mucha's nymph-like women set against the seasonal views of the countryside breathed new life into the classic theme. In the four panels shown here, Mucha captures the moods of the seasons - innocent Spring, sultry Summer, fruitful Autumn and frosty Winter, and together they represent the harmonious cycle of Nature.",

Interestingly, even at his most literal, Bosch is still able to include a vast amount of symbolism into his descriptions of each of the seven deadly sins. Those sent to hell for the sin of greed are boiled in pots of gold, and in the sin of pride a demon holds a mirror up to a prideful woman. The series of paintings is much more than a description of each sin and its punishment, as a whole it represents a warning to those who would engage in sin, and acts as a deterrent to evil doing. ",

    "description": "This painting, depicting a scene at the Folies-Bergere nightclub in Paris, is considered Manet’s last major work. It can also be seen as early twentieth century product placement, with the beers in the foreground on the bar, which are clearly Bass Pale Ale. As England’s first registered trademark, this indicated an English clientele at the bar that night. There has also been much commentary on the composition of the painting, which at first seems to be a mirror image of the girl in the background. Upon closer inspection, however, it is obvious that the placement is incorrect, that it cannot be a mirror image. Other conjectures include that the woman in the foreground is the illustration of what the man in the background is seeing upon approaching the bar. \r\n",

On the left side of the painting there is an inn, and in the right side of the painting there is a church. The juxtaposition is meant to illustrate the two sides of human nature: pleasure and religious chastity, and the contrast between the two. Near the church sit well-behaved children. Near the inn are rambunctious drunkards. The fat man in the middle of the painting, with the pie on his head, is a representation of “carnival.” The painting represents a common theme in 16th century Europe, the battle between Carnival and Lent, and with its humor and witticism, is a satirical critique on the conflicts of the Reformation.

    "description": "[i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i], Jan Vermeer’s most famous painting, is often called the ‘Dutch Mona Lisa’. The comparison to Leonardo Da Vinci’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/mona-lisa][i]Mona Lisa[/i][/url] (ca. 1504) makes sense: both paintings share an air of mystery, from the model’s enigmatic gaze to the speculations surrounding the identities of the women in the paintings. The identity of the model in [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] remains unknown. Some have suggested that it is Vermeer’s eldest daughter, Maria, however there is no compelling evidence to confirm this assertion.\n\nThe painting is considered a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/tronie#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]tronie[/url], a subcategory of portraiture that was popular in the Dutch Golden Age and Flemish [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Baroque[/url] art. Tronies are studies of facial characteristics, stereotypical characters or exaggerated expressions. Vermeer captures a fleeting moment, the girl turning her head, her lips slightly parted while she directly faces the viewer. The girl wears a head wrap inspired by a Turkish turban and an enormous pearl earring. These exotic elements increase the drama of the painting, and give the artist the opportunity to display artistic effects in his treatment of light and texture. Another tronie by Vermeer, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/study-of-a-young-woman][i]Study of A Young Woman[/i][/url] (ca. 1665-1667) is often seen as a variant or counterpart of [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i]. In both paintings, the figures are set against a black background, wearing the pearl earring and having a scarf draped over the shoulder. While [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] is an idealized beauty, the [i]Study of A Young Woman[/i] shows plain and imperfect facial features.\n\nEven though [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] is consistent with Vermeer’s style and technique, it is distinct in a few noteworthy ways. Vermeer used his inventive method of layering paint that created the sensuality of the soft skin. This was accomplished by layering a thin flesh-colored glaze over a transparent under-modelling (the initial layers of color placed on the surface). Some have suggested that Vermeer was able to capture these details and effects through the use of [i]camera obscura[/i], an optical device that was able to project an image onto a flat surface. Vermeer employed this technique in other paintings, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/woman-holding-a-balance-1665][i]Woman Holding a Balance[/i][/url] (1665) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/young-woman-with-a-water-pitcher][i]Young Woman with a Water Pitcher[/i][/url] (ca. 1662-1665). In both cases, Vermeer used this technique of layering paint when creating the shaded portions of the headdress on the models.  However, in [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i], the application of paint is bolder and more expressive. In a 1994 restoration, it was discovered that Vermeer accentuated girl’s mouth with small dots of pink paint, and placed light accents in her eyes to brighten her face. The model is set against a dark background, which is very different than the detailed settings of Vermeer’s interior paintings, such as the mentioned [i]Woman Holding a Balance[/i] and [i]Young Woman with a Water Pitcher[/i]. In the interior settings, the women are portrayed in contemplative and quiet moments, while [i]The Girl with a Pearl Earring[/i] has a sense of immediacy and drama. The painting has a timeless quality, the girl bears no symbolic attributes, and she is not placed in any specific context. For this reason, she has captured the imagination of viewers throughout generations.",

    "description": "Monet’s technique of “en plein air” painting was hard at work on this painting. Because it necessitated that he work from the same point of view as he painted, he dug a trench for the bottom half of the painting to sit in while he painted the top, due to its large size (it measures 100 by 81 inches). His model for the women of the painting was Camille Doncieux, who would later become his wife, bearing him two sons. To finish the dresses in the most fashionable style, Monet used magazine illustrations to render the clothing. ",

The scene is of hunters returning with their dogs from an unsuccessful hunting expedition. Scientists have used his portrayal of the wintry scene to corroborate evidence on the severity of the Little Ice Age, during which the painting was created. Also created during a time of religious revolution in the Netherlands, Brueghel is giving us a secular illustration of what country life should look like. ",

These paintings are now called the Black Paintings, referring to the mental state of Goya during this dark time in his life, due to his bout with illness, which made him deaf, as well internal strife in Spain. This painting was completed of the walls of his dining room, and is a rendition of Saturn, the Roman mythological character, who, fearing that his children would one day overthrow him, ate each one of them upon their births.

He developed a special relationship with this landscape and painted many rendition of it, especially the mountain in the background. The painting clearly illustrates the way Cezanne sought to depict the nature of reality and our perception of it. The mountain gives way to simple forms and the building in the foreground have been devolved into their particular shapes, all the while keeping the entirety of the landscape intact. Cezanne’s use of light and color give the impression that it is not his rendering of the landscape that give it a fragmented quality, but that it is an inherent quality of the landscape itself.  ",

Because of threats and violence against her, she is escorted by four U.S. Deputy Marshals; the painting is framed such that the marshals' heads are cropped at the shoulders.On the wall behind her is written the racial slur \"nigger\" and the letters \"KKK\"; a smashed tomato thrown at Bridges is also visible. The white crowd is not visible, as the viewer is looking at the scene from their point of view. The painting was originally published as a centerfold in the January 14, 1964 issue of Look.",

    "description": "When Manet exhibited Olympia at the Paris Salon in 1865, it caused an immediate sensation. Although it was immediately condemned as “immoral” and “vulgar” by conservative critics, it was lauded by critics such as Emile Zola, the French writer, who proclaimed the painting to be Manet’s masterpiece. Unlike Titian’s Venus de Urbino or Giorgione’s Sleeping Venus, both of which were sources of inspiration for Olympia, Manet’s work was overtly sexual. The small bits of clothing, such as the orchid in her hair, jewelry, and the mule slippers, in addition to the fully clothed servant, seem to make the figure seem even more nude. Her confrontational gaze was an affront to the perfunctory modesty with which women were supposed to behave. ",

    "description": "The Nude Maja was the first in a two painting series, the second of which was The Clothed Maja, respectively. It is said to be the first painting in which female pubic hair is visible, making it totally profane at the time. The identity of the model in the image is under debate, with some art historians thinking the model was the mistress of Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy, who commissioned the paintings, or that it was Goya’s mistress. Many art historians agree that the model was a compilation of many female figures. In 1813, the Spanish Inquisition confiscated both of the paintings as obscene, returning them to the Academy of Fine Arts in 1936, after Goya’s death. In the 1930’s Spain issued postage stamps with the image of the Maja, and subsequently all mail bearing the stamps were denied entrance into the United States. ",

Millet later changed the painting to include a steeple in the background and change the name from Prayer for the Potato Crop to The Angelus. The painting changed hands many times, ending with a bidding war between France and America. The painting has also been a source of speculation, due to Salvador Dali’s insistence that the figures are actually praying over their deceased child. Dali was so insistent that the painting was eventually x-rayed, revealing a shape that looked like a small coffin, indicating that Dali may have been right, and that Millet may have originally created the painting with the couple mourning over their small child’s coffin.

    "description": "Edward Hopper said that Nighthawks was inspired by \"a restaurant on New York's Greenwich Avenue where two streets meet,\" but the image, with its carefully constructed composition and lack of narrative, has a timeless quality that transcends its particular locale. One of the best-known images of 20th-century art, the painting depicts an all-night diner in which three customers, all lost in their own thoughts, have congregated. Fluorescent lights had just come into use in the early 1940s, and the all-night diner emits an eerie glow, like a beacon on the dark street corner. Hopper eliminated any reference to an entrance, and the viewer, drawn to the light, is shut out from the scene by a seamless wedge of glass. The four anonymous and uncommunicative night owls seem as separate and remote from the viewer as they are from one another. Reworked and parodied countless times, Nighthawks has become an icon of American culture.",

The wall painting was commissioned by the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, who was Leonardo’s patron during his first extended stay in Milan.\n\nThe composition of [i]The Last Supper[/i] is neatly arranged - Jesus is positioned in the center of a long table and the Apostles are to his left and right. The room is relatively plain: dark tapestries cover the walls on either side, while three windows on the back wall reveal a landscape that recalls the countryside of Milan. Leonardo created the illusion of space by using linear perspective – a technique in which all parallel lines in the painting converge in a single vanishing point. In [i]The Last Supper[/i], the single vanishing point, at Jesus’s right temple, draws the viewer’s attention to the main subject in the foreground. Jesus adorns the traditional blue and red robes, but he has no halo. Some scholars have suggested that Leonardo alludes to the halo through the shining light from the window behind Jesus, or the pediment above the window. Others however believed that the absence of the halo signifies the fact that Jesus is a still human being, who, as such, will suffer through the pain and death of the Passion.\n\nIn his depiction of [i]The Last Supper[/i], Leonardo chose to present the scene as a depiction of successive moments: Jesus has declared to the Apostles that one of them will betray him, and the Apostles react to his announcement. The serene expression and posture of Christ stands in contrast to the confused and agitated state of the Apostles. Their reactions and postures vary, adding interest and drama to the composition: on Christ’s left, James the Greater throws his arms out in anger, Thomas gestures to the sky as if to question God’s plan, and Phillip points towards himself wondering could he be the traitor. Some reactions hold additional symbolism: Peter holds a knife behind his back that he will later use to cut off an ear of a soldier attempting to arrest Christ. Judas, who is next to Peter, tightly grips the purse with the reward he received for betraying Jesus with one hand, while he reaches toward a dish with the other. Judas and Jesus reach for the same dish, a reference to the biblical quote: “[i]The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me[/i]” (Matthew 26:23).\n\nWhen painting [i]The Last Supper[/i] Leonardo used an experimental technique, working with tempera and oil paint. The experimental technique combined with the humidity and the dampness of the location led to the quick deterioration of the painting. Over the centuries, the painting suffered additional damage. Due to its poor condition, the painting underwent a major restoration that began in 1978. The restoration, completed in 1999, proved controversial: many were dissatisfied with the outcome saying that hardly any of Leonardo’s original work is visible. Still, some praised the recovery of many details, like the food on the table and the facial expressions.",

    "description": "A recently discovered penciled inscription, in the artist's hand, on the back of this famous painting reads: \"The instruction of the new ones by Valentine the Boneless.\" Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was thus not depicting an ordinary evening at the Moulin Rouge, the fashionable Parisian nightclub but rather a specific moment when a man now known only by his nickname (which certainly describes his nimbleness as a dancer) appears to be teaching the \"can-can.\" Many of the inhabitants of the scene are well-known members of Lautrec's demimonde of prostitutes and artists and people seen only at night including the white-bearded Irish poet William Butler Yeats who leans on the bar. One of the mysteries, however, is the dominant woman in the foreground, the beauty of her profile made all the more so in comparison with that of her chinless companion. It is the latter who expresses better than nearly any other character in this full stage of people Lautrec's profoundly touching ability to be brutally truthful but also truly kind in his observations",

    "description": "Although it was published in the 17th century, Cervantes’ novel Don Quixote was still very popular during the time Gustave Dore was chosen to illustrate the book in the 1860’s. His depiction of the farcical Quixote and the short and paunchy Sancho Panza became so famous that they influenced entire generations of readers. The images he created depicting Quixote, Panza, and the other characters through their episodes became so popular that they became the standard for the way in which people viewed the characters in the book. Further stage and film publications, as well as public image, were all based on Dore’s depiction of Quixote’s physical appearance.  ",

    "description": "This painting depicts a customary theme in medieval literature: the dance of Death, which was frequently used by Northern artists. Brueghel casts the entire work in a reddish-brown tone that gives the scene an infernal aspect appropriate for the subject at hand. The profusion of scenes and moralizing sense applied by the artists are part of Hieronymous Bosch´s influence on this work. Bruegel combines two distinct visual traditions within the panel. These are his native tradition of Northern woodcuts of the Dance of Death and the Italian conception of the Triumph of Death, as in frescoes he would have seen in the Palazzo Sclafani in Palermo and in the Camposanto Monumentale at Pisa.",

Manet, whose paintings often depicted scenes of leisurely activities, has included many of his friends as well as a self portrait in this work. Among the figures you can find Charles Baudelaire, Theophile Gautier, Henri Fantin-Latour, Jacques Offenbach, Manet’s brother Eugene, and a self portrait of the artist himself.",

Danae was the symbol of divine love, transcendence, and sensational beauty. By positioning the model with a raised leg, this painting pays tribute to the Titian series of paintings by the same name. As the story goes, while Danae was imprisoned by her father, she was visited by Zeus, in the form of the golden rain flowing between her legs. Soon after Zeus’ visit, Danae became pregnant and gave birth to her son Perseus. ",

As it was meant solely for the exhibition, Klimt painted the mural lightly on the walls at the Vienna Secession Building. After the exhibition, the painting was preserved, but it was not again displayed until 1986, where it remains on display today. The mural’s popularity has cemented its fame as portions of it were printed on the Austrian 100 euro coin in 2004. The coin contains less suggestive elements of the painting, including a knight in armor symbolizing strength, a woman holding a wreath of victory symbolizing ambition, and a woman with head held down and clasped hands, symbolizing sympathy.

    "description": "Considered Mondrian’s masterpiece, Broadway Boogie Woogie is a shimmering combination of multi-colored grid lines, complete with blocks of color, all in the primary palette. This piece represents another development in the unique style of the artist, which may have been the most profound. After the abandonment of representational forms in 1913 and the reconciliation of his spiritual concerns with his aesthetic, Mondrian had finally developed the transition of solid black lines to lines consisting of multi-colored, vibrant hues, creating an entirely new feeling. This painting represents Mondrian’s seminal work as an artist, and unlike much of his work, is not entirely non-representational. One can see the grid of the Manhattan city streets and feel the beat of the boogie woogie music of which Mondrian was so fond.",

    "description": "The Blue Rider is perhaps Kandinsky’s most important painting from the early 1900’s, before he had fully developed his abstract style of music as sound. The painting illustrates a rider cloaked in blue, speeding through a greenish meadow. The painting’s intentional abstractness had led many art theorists to project their own representations onto the figure, some seeing a child in the arms of the blue rider. Allowing viewers to participate in the representations of the art was a technique that Kandinsky would use to great fruition in his many later works, which became more and more abstract as his career wore on.",

    "description": "Kandinsky spent nearly six months preparing to create this painting, at first intending the work to evoke a flood, baptism, destruction and rebirth all at the same time. He first outlined the work on an oversized wooden panel, but soon experienced an artistic block, and found himself unable to paint. Gabrielle Munter, his assistant at the time, told him that he was blocked, and he needed to release himself from his intellectual trappings surrounding the painting. She suggested that he simply repeat the word “uberflut,” meaning “flood” or “deluge,” focusing on the sound of the word rather than its meaning, releasing his mind from the artistic block and focusing only on the music of the word. Kandinsky set down to work, and completed the painting in three days, all the while repeating the word like a mantra. ",

    "description": "Freud painted many portraits of famous people throughout his career. The Queen is perhaps his most powerful and globally recognizable subject. While Freud normally worked large, this composition measures approximately nine and a half by six inches, making it one of his smallest paintings. Nonetheless, it depicts the British monarch as an imposing presence. The entire composition is filled by her face. A sliver of pearls adorns her throat, while atop her white hair is an elaborate, jeweled crown. The symmetrical details in the jewels and hair mark the parameters of the picture, and serve as a kind of psychic boundary for the work. The crown, an item Freud specifically requested she wear for the portrait, dominates the upper border of the picture.\n\nAfter agreeing to pose for the artist, the Queen met Freud for a sitting in May of 2000. Making an exception from his usual practice of making a studio appointment, Freud traveled for sittings to St. James Palace at the Royal Collection's Friary Court, where she sat for him at the picture conservation studio. The small canvas took over six months to complete and was finally finished in December of 2001. By the time he was ready to paint the crown the Queen, who had other obligations, had run out of time. So a model had to be used. Freud, always a lightning rod for controversy, was accused of painting the Queen in an unflattering and unduly harsh light.\n\nThe project sparked debate and got mixed reviews (some saw it as a cheap publicity stunt by an artist with fading talent). Yet in his forthright observation of the Queen's features, one sees a raw intensity Freud had maintained throughout his career and refused to minimize, regardless of his subject. Among the more intriguing interpretations of this portrait, recently discussed by independent art historian Simon Abrahams, is that the Queen is a symbolic stand-in for the artist himself, a kind of alter-ego. The Queen's aging features in this portrait are remarkably similar to those of Freud himself, and the British press complained that the portrait looked nothing like her, adding credence to the theory.",

As it was meant solely for the exhibition, Klimt painted the mural lightly on the walls at the Vienna Secession Building. After the exhibition, the painting was preserved, but it was not again displayed until 1986, where it remains on display today. The mural’s popularity has cemented its fame as portions of it were printed on the Austrian 100 euro coin in 2004. The coin contains less suggestive elements of the painting, including a knight in armor symbolizing strength, a woman holding a wreath of victory symbolizing ambition, and a woman with head held down and clasped hands, symbolizing sympathy.

Rudolph had collected such a vast amount of paintings that his collection was one of the greatest in Europe.

For Bruegel the composition is unusually traditional. Perhaps because he was treating such a solemn religious event, he adopted a well-known scheme. Christ's insignificance among the crowds is a familiar device of mannerist painting, as is the artificial placing of Mary and her companions in a rocky foreground, which is deliberately distanced from the dramatic events taking place behind them.",

He began the paintings at the end of the summer of 1890, and continued until the next springs, using the harvests near his home in Giverny, France. Because of the repetitious subject matter, in this series Monet was not as concerned about the haystacks themselves as he was depicting the differences in light and color surrounding the haystacks in the different seasons, time of day, and weather. The paintings are now held in galleries, museums, and private collections around the world, and are some of his most notable works. ",

    "description": "By 1874 Manet came under the sway of Monet's approach to painting quickly, out of doors. In the summer of that year, Manet stayed at his family's house in Gennevilliers, just across the Seine from Monet in Argenteuil. The Monet family was living in a house that Manet had helped them find the year before. This portrait of the Monet family—Camille Monet and Jean, with Claude Monet gardening at the left—is one of Manet's most significant essays in this new style. While Manet painted the Monet family, Renoir painted beside him and Monet worked nearby. Monet painted Manet at his easel (present location unknown), while Renoir, like Manet, painted Madame Monet, Jean Monet, and the rooster (http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/camille-monet-and-her-son-jean-in-the-garden-at-argenteuil-1874). In 1924, Monet recounted the circumstances of the day in his garden at Argenteuil: \"Manet, enthralled by the color and the light, undertook an outdoor painting of figures under trees. During the sitting, Renoir arrived. . . . He asked me for palette, brush and canvas, and there he was, painting away alongside Manet. The latter was watching him out of the corner of his eye. . . . Then he made a face, passed discreetly near me, and whispered in my ear about Renoir: 'He has no talent, that boy! Since you are his friend, tell him to give up painting!'\"",

    "description": "This landscape is unusual in its elevated, almost bird's-eye point of view. Such an angle can be seen as an attempt to look at the world in the Japanese way, natural for an artist obsessed with Japan. However, we cannot speak of serious influence here: Van Gogh's view was individual and came from his own impressions. The dynamism distinguishing this canvas is alien to Far Eastern landscapes. The painting has an enormous internal energy. The crossing diagonals forming the borders of the fields and the ploughed furrows, the contours of the roofs, the row of cypresses - such vectors strain the composition, but not so much as to disturb the unity of the whole. It is a study from nature. The colouring of the painting and the action of the figures show us that it was executed in autumn, a time when Van Gogh worked not only on the hospital grounds, but outside them as well.",

Similarly to Daumier’s works, Gargantua delved into a social commentary, searching into the meaning of words and how or when they were considered obscene, as well as the many social institutions and their effectiveness and reasoning. Because of this drawing portraying the king in an unfavorable light, Daumier was imprisoned for six months at Saint Pelagic. After his release and return to society, the journal that published Daumier’s works, La Caricature, soon after discontinued circulation.  ",

    "description": "Kandinsky’s On White II expresses an intelligent combination of the two main colors in the painting: black and white. Kandinsky used color to represent more than just shapes and figures in his paintings. In this painting the many dimensions of the color white is used to represent the many possibilities and opportunities available in life. The color black, on the other hand, represents non-existence and death. Kandinsky expressed the color black as the silence of death, and in this painting, the black cuts through the white background with a riotous effect, shattering the peace of the colorful combination of colors, or as it were, opportunities in life.",

    "description": "One of the most famous paintings in Russian art, Black Square marked the turning point of the Russian avant-garde movement. Before creating this painting, Malevich spent eighteen months in his studio, laboring over thirty non-objective paintings. In the end, he had created a series of non-objective paintings, of which Black Square is one. His invention of the word “suprematism” was meant to refer to the supremacy of the new geometric forms. Although the other works in this period were created with visual brushstrokes and asymmetrical forms, Black Square was the prominent piece, with no visual textures and a perfectly symmetrical shape, as it was the paramount of Malevich’s change to pure geometric abstraction: suprematism.

    "description": "Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge is one of Lissitzky's earliest attempts at propagandistic art. He produced this politically charged work in support of the Red Army shortly after the Bolsheviks had waged their revolution in 1917. The red wedge symbolized the revolutionaries, who were penetrating the anti-Communist White Army. Here Lissitzky uses his signature coded color combination of red, white and black, which reinforces the message indicated by the work's title. Colors and shapes take on directly symbolic significance. For example, the smooth, curvilinear walls of the white circle are pierced by the sharp point of the red triangle: the Red Army has pierced the defenses of the White Army. Dramatic color contrasts also create confusion regarding space-which area is positive? Which is negative? Meanwhile, small geometric forms in the limited color scheme float like tiny projectiles through the space along with text. Here, basic forms combine with actual text: painting and typography are fused. This work is an important precursor to Lissitzky's Prouns, when Suprematist art moved onto a three-dimensional visual plain.",

    "description": "Settling in Paris in 1952, Freud painted many portraits, including Hotel Bedroom (1954), which features a woman lying in a bed with white sheets pulled up to her shoulders. Her left hand rests on her cheek, and her gaze is fixed on a faraway place. In sharp contrast, a standing man is standing behind her and staring at her. His dark form looms over her menacingly, silhouetted against the sunlight. Other windows in the building across the street are visible in the background.\n\nThe man is Freud himself, and the woman is Lady Caroline Hamilton Temple Blackwood, the Guinness ale heiress with whom he eloped in 1952 after the divorce from his first wife. At the time they were staying at the Hotel La Louisiane, and the work reflects the anxiety and tension in their relationship, which had already begun to unravel. She would soon leave him, and the distraught Freud, while having many more relationships, would never marry again. This painting is among the works that Freud exhibited it at the Venice Biennale when he was invited to serve as the representative of Britain in 1954, a great honor. Like this and other early portraits by the artist, the work has a flat, drawing-like quality. Here, however, the body of the artist is a black hole, threatening to suck the light out of the rest of the picture. The artist's standing pose also seems to predict a turning point in his working method. This is the last portrait he completed while sitting down. From that point on, he chose to stand while painting. One of his more narrative works, it exemplifies the autobiographical self-absorption and detachment associated with his later work.",

It depicts Mount Fuji in a deep, saturated red; thin white lines of snow tracing lines down from the tip of the peak. Small clusters of clouds fill the sky, and tiny trees grow to the base of the mountain, indicating its massive size. Hokusai’s infatuation with Mount Fuji was much more than an admiration of its beauty. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter told that a goddess placed an elixir of life at the top of the peak, and thus the mountain was a secret source of immortality, as well as a secret reason for Hokusai’ obsession with the mountain.

In addition to theatre costumes and set designs, tapestries, and designs and decorations for court celebrations, he also dabbled in gouache. This piece is one of only three gouache paintings by the artist. This piece, which was probably produced as an independent work, rather than as a study for a painting, bears a striking resemblance to another one of his paintings, Venus on the Waves. Boucher was a master at depicting idyllic classical scenes, and in this one we see his adeptness at portraying the mythical scene of impassive Venus, surrounded by nymphs and tritons, all paying tribute to the goddess of love.

The themes in the series ranged from love and death, sex, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy and the stages of life, and included the famous painting The Scream. This painting captures an intimate moment between two nudes, the woman pulling the man towards her in a lover’s embrace, mouths locked in a passionate kiss, and is an example of Munch’s theme of the femme fatal as the dominant creature, taking control to feed her sexual appetite.

    "description": "One of the most famous works by Paul Gauguin, [i]Vision After the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel[/i] (1888) was painted during the artist's stay in Pont-Aven, Brittany. The painting refers to the biblical story of Jacob, who crossed the river Jabbok and spent the night wrestling a mysterious angel. The artist depicts the subject indirectly, showing a group of Breton women after a sermon in church. The women moved by the sermon see a vision of Jacob wrestling the angel.\n\nThe available information about the painting comes primarily from two sources: letters written by Gauguin and writings by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism]Post-Impressionist[/url] artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/emile-bernard]Emile Bernard[/url]. Bernard spent the summer of 1888 with Gauguin in Pont-Aven – the two worked side by side, and while Gauguin painted [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i] Bernard worked on the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/emile-bernard/breton-women-in-the-meadow-1888][i]Breton Women in the Meadow[/i][/url] (1888). The two paintings share stylistic similarities and are both examples of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/cloisonnism]Cloisonnism[/url] – a post-impressionist style characterized by bold flat forms enclosed by dark outlines. Both artists also shared an affinity for Japanese art, and Bernard wrote that the motif of [i]Jacob wrestling the angel in Vision After the Sermon[/i] was modeled after [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai]Hokusai[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai/all-works#!#filterName:Theme_sumo-wrestlers,resultType:masonry]Sumo Wrestlers[/url].\n\nGauguin used the term [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/synthetism]Synthetism[/url] to describe paintings such as [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i], in which he aimed to synthesize between the outward appearance of the subject, the artist’s emotional response to the subject, and the aesthetic considerations of line, form, and color. In [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i], Gauguin creates a synthesis between two realities: the everyday life of the Breton women and their vision of the biblical event. In a letter to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent Van Gogh[/url], he wrote about the sermon that inspired the painting: “For me, the landscape and the fight only exist in the imagination of the people praying after the sermon which is why there is a contrast between the life-size people and the struggle in its non-natural disproportionate landscape”. For this reason, Gauguin emphasized the contrast between the dramatic fight scene and the serenity of the women quietly praying.\n\nBy weaving together different Christian symbols, Gauguin added new content and meaning to the religious subject. In the foreground, he depicted twelve Breton women in prayer, a symbolic reference to Jacob’s twelve sons, the predecessors of the twelve tribes of Israel. The apple tree in the center of the composition was another non-traditional addition to the story of Jacob. In the bible, the apple tree is a symbol of knowledge, a reference to man’s awakening, and subsequently his fall from grace. In [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i], the apple tree is full and lush, suggesting the possibility of man’s redemption and a possible return to paradise. Another important component is the bull emerging from the left corner of the painting. The bull is possibly a sacrificial animal, and as such, it can hint to the sacrifice of Christ and the chance for redemption. The bull is also connected to Breton, it is a symbol attributed to four Breton saints. In this way, Gauguin formed a connection between his unique symbolism and the spirituality of the devout Breton women.",

    "description": "The portrait [i]Lady with an ermine[/i] (1489-1490) by Leonardo Da Vinci depicts Cecilia Gallerani, the teenage mistress of Ludovico Sforza, the regent and later the Duke of Milan. While some scholars doubted this identification, ample evidence affirms Cecilia Gallerani is the subject of [i]Lady with an ermine[/i]. The earliest mention of the portrait appears in a sonnet by court poet Bernardo Bellincioni, in which he notes that it seems as if Cecilia is listening to an unseen speaker. Further confirmation exists in a correspondence between Cecilia and Isabella d’Este, the marquise of Mantua. In her letter, the marquise asks Cecilia to send her the portrait so she can compare Leonardo’s work to that of another master, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giovanni-bellini]Giovanni Bellini[/url]. Most importantly, the correspondence reveals that although Ludovico commissioned the painting, Cecilia owned it.\n\nIt is possible that because Cecilia was not of the highest rank, Leonardo allowed himself the freedom to break away from local conventions of portraiture. Most notably, he abandoned the local tradition of the profile portrait in favor of a three quarter view of the subject. Through the innovative pose Leonardo provoked the viewer’s curiosity and engaged them with the sitter of the portrait: she seems to be attentively gazing at something or someone out of view at the right side of the picture. The lady holds the ermine with her left hand, while her right hand elegantly caresses the animal’s shoulder. The suggestive hand gesture recurs in Leonardo’s later composition [i]Leda and the Swan[/i]  - even though the oil painting did not survive, the overall composition is known from [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/leda-and-the-swan-1506]drawings[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/il-sodoma/leda-and-the-swan-copy-of-leonardo-da-vinci-1515]oil copies[/url] made after Leonardo’s painting. In [i]Lady with an ermine[/i], Leonardo also demonstrated tremendous skill in his treatment of contrasting textures: the smooth skin next to the ermine’s fur, the carved jet-black beads against the chest and the intricately woven dress, the embroidered garment besides the smooth plain silk.\n\nOne of the key elements of the painting is the lively creature Cecilia holds in her arms. In fact, the symbolism of the ermine provides further evidence supporting the identification of Cecilia as the sitter. The ermine is a symbol of moderation and purity, and as such, its inclusion is appropriate for a portrait of a mistress of a Renaissance duke. Scholars also pointed to the fact that the Greek word for ermine is [i]galé[/i], thus it is a play on the Cecelia’s surname (Gallerani). Additionally, some have suggested that the ermine is an emblem associated to Ludovico, thus the ermine can be interpreted as an allusion to Cecilia’s lover.\n\n[i]Lady with an ermine[/i] was purchased in Italy around 1800 by the Polish Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski. He brought the painting to Poland, where he presented it to his mother, the Princess Izabella. The painting was incorporated into the family collection in Puławy, the museum founded by Princess Izabella in 1796. Today, it is the highlight of the collection at the Czartoryski Museum in Kraków, and is considered one of Poland’s national treasures.",

    "description": "This painting was commissioned by the provisional government of Spain, upon Goya’s suggestion, to commemorate the invasion of Spain by Napoleon’s troops in 1808. At the time it was painted, the painting was considered groundbreaking and revolutionary, as it presents the horrors of war that had heretofore not been openly illustrated. The painting focuses on one man, illuminated in white light in the middle of the painting, arms held out to the sides, facing a French firing squad. His slain companions litter the ground. It is thus considered one of the first pieces of modern art. This painting has influence a number of other artists, who have directly referenced the style and setting of the painting, including Edouard Manet and Pablo Picasso. ",

    "description": "Caravaggio (1571-1610) painted two versions of the Head of Medusa. The first in 1596 and the other presumably in 1597/8. The first version also known as Murtula, due to the poet who wrote about it (48x55 cm) is signed Michel A F, (Michel Angelo Fecit) and was found on the painter’s studio only after his dead. Nowadays it belongs to a private collection whilst the second version, slightly bigger (60 x 55 cm) is not signed and it is in the Uffizi Gallery, in Florence. \r\nThe “Head of Medusa” executed by Caravaggio, in 1598, was commissioned as a cerimonial shield by Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, the Medici family’s agent in Rome, after seeing, on the painters studio, the first version – The Metula painting. The purpose of this commissioned was to symbolize the Grand Duke of Tuscany's courage in defeating his enemies. For its subject matter, Caravaggio drew on the Greek myth of Medusa, a woman with snakes for hair who turned people to stone by looking at them. \r\nMedusa was a Gorgon monster, a terrifying female creature from the Greek Mythology. While descriptions of Gorgons vary across Greek literature, the term commonly refers to any of three sisters who had hair of living, venomous snakes, and a horrifying visage that turned those who beheld it to stone. Traditionally, while two of the Gorgons were immortal, Stheno and Euryale , their sister Medusa was not, and was slain by the mythical hero Perseus, the legendary founder of Mycenae and of the Perseid dynasty. According to the story, she was killed by Perseus, who avoided direct eye contact by using a mirrored shield. After Medusa’s death, her decapitated head continued to petrify those that looked at it. \r\nCaravaggio plays with this concept by modeling himself for Medusa’s face – making him the only one who is safe from Medusa’s dedly gaze – and having to look at his reflection to paint the shield in the same way that Medusa caught her own image moments before being killed. Although Caravaggio depicts Medusa’s severed head, she remains conscious. He heightens this combination of life and death through Medusa’s intense expression. Her wide-open mouth exudes a silent but dramatic scream and her shocked eyes and furrowed brow all suggest a sense of disbelief, as if she thought herself to be invincible until the moment. But Caravaggio’s Medusa does not have the full effect of scaring the viewer, since she does not look at us, thereby transferring the power of the gaze to the viewer and emphasizing her demise. Caravaggio displays huge technical achievements in this work by making a convex surface look concave and Medusa’s head appear to project outward.",

    "description": "Dore created many illustrations for The Idylls of the King, a set of twelve poems by the English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson. The poems retell the story of King Arthur and his knights, the rise and fall of his kingdom, and his love for Guinevere, and her subsequent betrayal of him. Tennyson’s retelling of the Arthur legends was a commentary on the Victorian Era of the times in which he lived, and it was a very popular literary theme during Dore’s lifetime. The cycle of narrative poems were published during Dore’s lifetime, beginning in 1856, the last one being published in 1885, two years after his death. As such, his illustrations of the poems were one of his last works before his death. ",

His moral is that in the mind of God children's games possess as much significance as the activities of their parents. This idea was a familiar one in contemporary literature: in an anonymous Flemish poem published in Antwerp in 1530 by Jan van Doesborch, mankind is compared to children who are entirely absorbed in their foolish games and concerns.",

The first illustrated version of the poem appeared in the fourth edition of the work, in 1688, and later, other artists, such as William Blake and Salvador Dali have been inspired to create illustrations inspired by the work. Dore’s illustrations of Paradise Lost were some of his later works, and also some of the most famous. ",

It was first exhibited in 1872, where it was criticized as ugly and disgusting, and a later exhibition in 1892 it was removed from the show.

He creates a highly emotional story with the combination of elements of traditional Byzantine paintings, such as the dimensional layout and iconography, with his stylized faces showing an emotional response to the death of Christ. The result pulls the viewer into the scene by inviting them to witness the pain and anguish of the Lamentation. You can almost hear the sobs of the women and the shrieks from the angels above. This realistic depiction of emotion on human faces set him apart from other artists of his day, turning Christ and his followers into real human beings with real emotion.",

Many of his paintings contained the basic elements of an interlocking grid of black lines and blocks of the three primary colors.

It was in this later period of his work that Mondrian work until his hands blistered or he made himself cry. During this time, he was also rearranging and painting his Manhattan studio apartment in a similar grid and block pattern, which he changed and re-painted upon completion off certain canvases or projects.

Upon its debut, Guillaume Apollinaire, referencing the negative reviews of previous years, exclaimed that this year, there would be no ridicule, as the painting exuded sheer beauty. With this piece, Rousseau brought together the exotic and the ordinary, the jungle and the couch, and combined the two to form a juxtaposition of composition which engages and intrigues. It is perhaps fitting that this was his last painting before his death, as it was his masterpiece. ",

    "description": "Degas regularly went to the Paris opera house, not only as a member of the audience, but as a visitor backstage and in the dance studio, where he introduced by a friend who played in the orchestra. At that time, the opera was still housed in the rue Le Peletier and had not yet moved to the building designed by Garnier which was soon to replace it. From the 1870s until his death, Degas's favourite subjects were ballerinas at work, in rehearsal or at rest, and he tirelessly explored the theme with many variations in posture and gesture.\r\nMore than the stage performance and the limelight, it was the training and rehearsals that interested him. Here the class is coming to an end – the pupils are exhausted, they are stretching, twisting to scratch their backs, adjusting their hair or clothes, an earring, or a ribbon, paying little heed to the inflexible teacher, a portrait of Jules Perrot, a real-life ballet master.\r\n\r\nDegas closely observed the most spontaneous, natural, ordinary gestures, the pauses when concentration is relaxed and the body slumps after the exhausting effort of practising and the implacable rigour of the class.\r\n\r\nThe slightly raised viewpoint looking diagonally across the studio accentuates the vanishing perspective of floor boards. Paul Valéry wrote: \"Degas is one of the very few painters who gave the ground its true importance. He has some admirable floors\". This is all the more appropriate for dancers in that the parquet, which was moistened to prevent slipping, is their main work tool. And the ballet master beats time on the floor with his baton.",

    "description": "For The Potato Eaters, Van Gogh’s first major work, he wanted to depict peasants as they really were. He thus chose coarse and ugly models, so they would look as natural as possible in the final work. He made sketches of the work and sent them to his brother, who helped Van Gogh make adjustment in the composition. As far as two years after Van Gogh completed this painting, he considered it his finest work. This painting has also been a main target for art thieves, who have stolen it not once, but twice times. An early version of the painting was stolen in 1988, but later returned with no ransom, and again in 1991, when it was abandoned by the thieves and recovered.",

In 1985, a man threw acid on the painting as it hung on display at the Hermitage Museum. He also cut the canvas twice with a knife. The most badly damaged parts of the painting were to the face and hair of Danae, her right arm, and her legs. The entire middle section of the painting was also dripping with a conglomeration of paint spots. Restoration of the painting began the same day, and was finished twelve years later. Then man who threw the acid was later declared insane. ",

In this episode, he is attempting to smother his unsuspecting audience with rose petals, which have been let loose from false ceiling panels. Alma-Tadema, being a meticulous perfectionist, wanted each petal to be as perfectly realistic as possible, and had shipments of rose petals sent to him from the Riviera over the winter of 1887-1888, so he would have fresh examples. This was a common practice by Alma-Tadema, who often ordered flowers from all over Europe and sometimes Africa, as examples for his paintings, rushing to complete the work before the flowers died. ",

    "description": "Even though servants and kitchen maids were recurring characters in 17th century Dutch [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/genre-painting?select=featured#!#filterName:featured,viewType:masonry]genre paintings[/url], Jan Vermeer’s [i]The Milkmaid[/i] is a unique example, in which the kitchen maid is the subject of a single figure portrait. The milkmaid is fully absorbed in her activity, carefully pouring the milk. Even though the surrounding objects indicate that the milkmaid is in a kitchen, the indoor setting was kept relatively bare. X-ray studies of the painting show that Vermeer decided to eliminate a wall hanging, probably a map, from the back wall. Additionally, there was a basket of clothes in the right corner that the artist replaced with a footwarmer. By making these adjustments, the artist placed greater emphasis on the milkmaid and her activity. \n\nThis representation stands in contrast to other depictions of servants by his contemporaries, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolaes-maes/the-idle-servant-1655][i]The idle servant[/i][/url] (1655) by Dutch Golden Age painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolaes-maes]Nicolaes Maes[/url]. In [i]The idle servant[/i], Maes constructs a narrative, the kitchen maid that fell asleep in front of a heap of dishes and then was found by her mistress. Like most genre paintings, this painting has a moral aspect: the mistress gestures towards the sleeping maid and the dishes, as a warning against idleness. In comparison, [i]The Milkmaid[/i] does not present a story or anecdote, it simply describes a moment in time. For this reason, Vermeer’s composition displays only a limited space, directing the viewer’s attention to the milkmaid’s activity.\n \nVermeer’s milkmaid has a strong physical presence, created through expert use of light and shade. The light source is coming from the window and immersing the milkmaid in daylight. The artist created a light and dark contrast between the maid and the rear wall, in which the shaded parts of the wall correspond to where the light falls on the woman’s figure. Similarly, on the right side, the wall is lightest in order to enhance the shaded portion of the maid’s figure. Vermeer also emphasized her silhouette by painting a white contour line along her arm and shoulder. It was suggested that the pose of Vermeer’s milkmaid was inspired by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/domenico-fiasella]Domenico Fiasella[/url]’s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/domenico-fiasella/queen-artemisia-1645][i]Queen Artemisia[/i][/url] (ca. 1645).  Generally speaking, it would be unusual for an artist to base a genre painting of a kitchen maid on a portrait of an ancient Greek queen. However, given Vermeer’s deviation from common depictions of servants in [i]The Milkmaid[/i], the connection to Fiasella’s [i]Artemisia[/i] becomes more plausible. Vermeer depicted his milkmaid with empathy and dignity, and according to some the character also conveys morality. The portrayal of the maid concentrated on her work can relate to virtuosity and modesty, ideals of womanhood in Dutch 17th century society. The milkmaid displays her virtue through her diligent preparation of food. There are some elements in the painting that are indicative of romantic love, namely the footwarmer and the cupid tiles bordering the lower edge of the floor. However, because both of these are not prominent in the painting, it is unlikely that romantic love is the central theme. In this context, the footwarmer and the tiles symbolize human caring and the maid’s devotion toward others. In this way, these elements contribute to the central theme of the milkmaid pouring milk and providing nourishment.",

    "description": "In 'Office at Night', the light comes from three sources: an overhead light, the lamp on the man's desk, which sheds a small puddle of intense light, and from a street-light shining in the open window on the right-hand side. Hopper reported that the overlap of the light from the ceiling fixture and the light from the exterior created particular technical difficulties, since they required him to use different shades of white to convey the idea of degrees of shadow. A careful examination of the corner behind the woman reveals the faint shadow that she casts in the weak light of the ceiling fixture, almost lost by the sharply-etched shadow of the filing cabinet in the brighter light of the street lamp.",

    "description": "In [i]The Spring[/i],  Botticelli creates an intellectual painting, addressed to a narrow circle of public able to recognize complex literary, philosophical, and iconographic references. Such as those that were formulated in Florentine intellectual circles, created by the Medici family. There are many interpretations proposed to dissolve the message of this work, made up of symbols and allegories. The characters can be identified on the basis of the comparison with different literary sources: the poem [i]Stanze for the carousel[/i] by Angelo Poliziano, contemporary of Botticelli, or with the texts of Latin authors most read in the 15th century, such as Lucrezio, Ovidio, Orazio.\n\nThe painted scene takes place in the garden of the Hesperides, the garden of the gods where the golden apples grow, identified in the Renaissance with the earthy oranges and lemons (which is why in the courts of Italian nobles there was always a citrus grove). The flowery lawn is rich in many different types of wildflowers. The characters are divided into groups. On the right there is a narrative scene: Zephyrus, the biting wind that announces spring in March, tries to kidnap the nymph Flora, who, frightened, tries to escape the kidnapping. In the end, Flora, possessed by the god, would agree to marry him and, as a gift, would be transformed into Flora, the Spring, eternally young and fruitful divinity. \n\nIn the center of the painting is Venus, goddess of sacred love, leaning against a myrtle bush, the sacred plant that symbolizes her. Above her, Cupid flies high, blindfolded. His wings come out of the painting, he launches a fiery arrow towards the Three Graces, the three successive figures of the work, intent in a dance in a circle. The last character, on the left, is Mercury, the messenger god, which can be recognized by the winged shoes and the [i]petasus[/i], the typically pointed hat of travelers. The god, with his rod, the [i]caduceus[/i], keeps away the clouds that threaten this ideal and eternal garden, where everything is a harmony of forms and feelings, a perfect microcosm, mirror of a universal macrocosm.\n\nFramed by the plants of the garden, the characters are painted by Botticelli with graceful poses and seem to barely touch the lawn of flowers, as if they were very light. Botticelli has no interest in weighing the muscles of the figures: he paints them sinuously, using curves and not right angles, to give the idea of characters out of time. For this reason, the painter also chooses bright colors, sometimes transparent, as in the dress of the nymph or graces. Botticelli inserted more than five hundred plant species into the painting, of which only two hundred were coming from Tuscany, making this art a herbarium in painting.\n\nHowever, the possibility of identifying the characters does not exhaust the meaning of the work of art. Venus, in a central position, is here painted not as the goddess of love but, as the Humanists considered her, goddess of [i]humanitas[/i], intellectual activities that elevated men from the world of the senses, personified by Zephyr, to the world of reason, Mercury. For this reason, Zephyr and Mercury are placed at two opposite poles of the painting. The makers of this process are the three Graces, seen in the Renaissance as an allegory of intellectual faculties.\n\nTwo of the Graces wear jewelry from the Medici family at their necks, making explicit a political meaning of the painting, that can be read as an allegory of the task of the Medici family in Florence. The only lineage that, being patron and protector of artists, can ignite this process of elevation and the flowering of Florence, which could be the place of the intellectual Spring of the new world, reborn in the Renaissance. This thesis is supported by a documentary source that says that the painting was commissioned to Botticelli in 1478, for the birth of Giulio, son of Giuliano de Medici, brother of Lorenzo the Magnificent.\n\n[b]by Maddalena Mongera[/b]",

    "description": "[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/madonna-of-loreto][/url]This artwork was painted between 1987 - 1988, when Freud was already an established artist. The portrayed woman is one of his two daughters from his marriage with Kitty Garman (a daughter of a sculptor [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacob-epstein]Jacob Epstein[/url]).\n\nWhat is quite innovative in Freud’s approach to the depicted subject, is the perspective. The artist represents a lying body completely turned away from us, so we cannot see the facial expression - but still, the painting is quite expressive. The body is curled up in the fetal position, which can be interpreted as a reaction to a physical or psychological trauma. Representing his sleeping daughter like this, Freud may be suggesting that he is a helpless observer of her mental and emotional pain. He also is putting the viewer into a position of a voyeur who intrudes a woman’s personal space and gets the insight of how she feels. Besides, this painting could be read in a feminist key - a woman is expressing her trauma only when she is sleeping, only when she is unaware that others are watching.\n\nIn his paintings, Freud demonstrates a tangibility of humans - be it their emotional pain and struggle, or be it naturalism in depicting of their bodies. This tangibility of Annabel is shown in a brute physicality of her feet. The artist emphasizes small details, like motion of muscles and texture of the skin. He de-idealizes the human body, breaking with the tradition of representing a female figure as a beautiful and flawless object,  and insists on the corporeality of all bodies. This de-idealization reminds us of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio]Caravaggio[/url]’s realism, which can be seen in his works such as [i][url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/madonna-of-loreto]Madonna of Loreto[/url][/i], [i][url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/entombment]Entombment of Christ[/url][/i] or [i][url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/crucifixion-of-saint-peter-1601]Crucifixion of Saint Peter[/url][/i]. In a similar manner, Caravaggio’s depiction of saints’ dirty feet highlights the imperfection of the human body and human nature.",

    "description": "Rousseau described the subject of The Sleeping Gypsy: “A wandering Negress, a mandolin player, lies with her jar beside her (a vase with drinking water), overcome by fatigue in a deep sleep. A lion chances to pass by, picks up her scent yet does not devour her. There is a moonlight effect, very poetic.” A toll collector for the city of Paris, Rousseau was a largely self-taught painter, although he had ambitions of entering the Academy. This goal was never realized, but his sharp colors, fantastic imagery, and precise outlines—derived from the style and subject matter of popular print culture— struck a chord with a younger generation of avant-garde painters, including Pablo Picasso, Vasily Kandinsky, and Frida Kahlo.",

    "description": "This is one of the earliest examples of Freud's mature style. Unconventional poses were one of Freud's specialties. The subject matter is conventional, but the pose is one rarely, if ever, seen in traditional Western portraiture. The subject is Tim Behrens, a friend and student at Slade School of Art, where Freud was a visiting teacher. The work's generic title, giving no hint of the specifics of the sitter or the setting, reflects the consistent, clinical detachment with which Freud approached all subjects, no matter what their relationship to him. Red Haired Man on a Chair (1962) depicts Behrens perched with his knees tucked under him, dressed in a gray suit, and with his brown shoes resting on a chair that appears to tilt toward us. The wooden post and discarded pile of cloths behind him indicate that the environment is the painting studio. At this point in his career, Freud made a transition from sable to hog-hair brushes which allowed both greater control and an ability to apply broad strokes in the heavily impastoed style one sees here.\n\nIt is clear that Freud has reached a new level of sophistication. Witness, for example, the linear tension between the figure and the post inches away, giving the appearance that if he leans a little more to the left he might actually touch it. Witness, too, the relationship between the vertical figure and the horizontal line of rags in the background, which forms a cross. Freud was not remotely religious, and certainly not Catholic, so this is a clever reference to the pose his student was holding, which was wildly uncomfortable and underscores his student's position as a martyr for the cause of great art. The observation, more sadistic than empathetic, characterizes Freud's approach to the human form, in particular his ability to suspend empathy with the sitter in order to observe him or her more closely. It is also one of the first examples of the appearance of rags strewn about in loose piles, a common compositional device in Freud's later portraits.",

Millet found the theme of women gleaning the last bits of wheat an eternal one, linked to stories of the Old Testament. The painting was received by the public with open scorn. It presented what at the time were the lowest ranks of society, taking advantage of the age-old right to remove the last bits of grain left over from wheat harvest, in a sympathetic light. During his lifetime, this painting garnered naught but notoriety from a French upper-class that feared glorifying the lower ranks of society, and it was not until after the artist’s death that it became more popular.

    "description": "In 1799, Goya was made First Court Painter, with an annual salary of 50,000 reales and an allowance for coach. It was during this time that he painted Charles IV of Spain and His Family. Goya completed this painting, modeled in the casual style of Velazquez’s Las Meninas, for the royal family of Spain. Although the figures in the painting are set in naturalistic and plausible poses, they are ostentatiously dressed in their finest clothing and jewelry. Modern critics have many interpretations about the paintings style and placement of the figures. Goya’s aversion to flatter the appearance of the figures may be his commentary on the corruption of King Charles IV. Furthermore, the placement of the Queen Louisa in the center of the painting may be an indication of her real power. ",

    "description": "The painting portrays a lone woman staring into a cup of coffee in an Automat at night. The reflection of identical rows of light fixtures stretches out through the night-blackened window.\r\nHopper's wife, Jo, served as the model for the woman.  However, Hopper altered her face to make her younger (Jo was 44 in 1927). He also altered her figure; Jo was a curvy, full-figured woman, while one critic has described the woman in the painting as \"'boyish' (that is, flat-chested)\" \r\nAs is often the case in Hopper's paintings, both the woman's circumstances and her mood are ambiguous. She is well-dressed and is wearing makeup, which could indicate either that she is on her way to or from work at a job where personal appearance is important, or that she is on her way to or from a social occasion.\r\nShe has removed only one glove, which may indicate either that she is distracted, that she is in a hurry and can stop only for a moment, or simply that she has just come in from outside, and has not yet warmed up. But the latter possibility seems unlikely, for there is a small empty plate on the table, in front of her cup and saucer, suggesting that she may have eaten a snack and been sitting at this spot for some time.",

    "description": "Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh had an early friendship, which blossomed into an invitation to Arles, France, where van Gogh wanted Gauguin to stay with him and create an art colony. This painting was completed during Gauguin’s stay in Arles, depicting van Gogh painting his famous work Sunflowers. Unfortunately, Gaugin and Van Gogh were unable to create their art colony, as Gauguin only stayed for two months. The pair quarreled, and in December of 1888, Gauguin confronted van Gogh with a razor blade. Van Gogh, panicking, fled to a brothel, where he cut off his lower left ear lobe. Gauguin later left and the two never saw each other again. ",

    "description": "This most famous and influential [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/neo-impressionism]Neo-Impressionist[/url] work depicts a cross-section of Paris society enjoying a Sunday afternoon in the park on an island in the Seine River just at the gates of Paris. Sunday was the time that middle-class Parisians escaped the city to enjoy the outdoors. The people primarily gather in small groups of two or three or sit alone in proximity to others. It is the relationship between these people that creates a sense of modernity, with its distance and disconnection, and nervous tension that lends the work an air of mystery.\n\nUsing a grid system and applying small dots of paint, Seurat took two years to complete this large-scale painting. He went to the park often, observing and making over 60 preliminary studies, including 15 in oil. Invoking Greek classical art, Seurat explained, \"The Panathenaeans of Phidias formed a procession. I want to make modern people, in their essential traits, move about as they do on those friezes, and place them on canvases organized by harmonies of color.\" Seurat hoped to capture the permanence, or essential forms, behind the fleeting moments. Everyone here is caught in a still pose, except for the child in the orange dress skipping off into the trees, the man on the far left playing trombone, and the furious little dog at the lower right. However, it seems a stillness that might burst into movement at any moment, just as the upper half of the painting moves into the sunlight and the boats in the distance cut across the river. While Seurat invoked classical and Egyptian figures, some have interpreted the overall static effect of the composition and the stiffness of the poses as a critique of the artificiality of modern society and the boredom of middle-class life.",

    "description": "Around 1475, Gaspare di Zanobi del Lama, a Florentine wealthy money changer and courtier of the Medici family, commissioned Sandro Botticelli, still a young painter protected by the Medici family, to paint an altarpiece for his funeral chapel in the church of Santa Maria Novella.\n\nThe work of the currency exchange was not well seen by the morality of the time: the people who exercised it were treated as usurers, because they got wealthy at the expense of their customers. For this reason, the members of the Arte del Cambio, the guild of which Gaspare di Zanobi was a part, used to invest great wealth in the creation of funerary monuments, making generous donations to the churches that accepted to host remains of them and their families. He wanted the chapel to be dedicated to the Epiphany, of which the Botticelli table was to be the main work of art. Above the table, Botticelli also painted the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/santa-maria-novella][i]Adoration of the Child[/i][/url] (1976), now detached and moved above the central portal of the Church, on the counter-façade.\n\nThe scene depicts the moment in which the three wise men, Magi, arrived at the birthplace of Jesus Christ. In the history of Florentine art, this scene was frequently painted. In Florence there never existed a real legitimate noble lineage, so every family that came to power commissioned to a painter an Adoration of the Magi and asked to portrait the members of the family as wise men bowed before Jesus, in order to show to the citizen that their government was blessed by God.\n\nBotticelli fitted into this tradition, but he wanted to produce new, original work. He painted the usual subject: the Magi arriving at the manger. But, if in previous paintings the scene was depicted with the Kings arrived at the stable stately manger fitting for the Son of God,  the young Botticelli chose to place the scene in a dilapidated Roman ruin. At the center of this structure, he placed a sturdy rock for Mary and Jesus, to sit high above their visitors. With this decision, Botticelli seemed to say: Christianity will be built on sturdier materials than Rome.\n\nThe painter then populated the space with important men from his city. On the right side of the artworks, dressed in light blue, is the man who paid for it: Gaspare di Zanobi del Lama, looking out at the viewer and confidently pointing at himself, as to say that he gifted this beautiful piece of art to humanity. To paint the three Magi, appearing at the center of this painting, kneeling to Mary and Jesus, Botticelli took as models the members of the Medici family. This is a tribute wanted by the purchaser of the work: his wealth would not have been possible had he not been a courtier protected by Medici. In particular, by Cosimo de Medici, whom Botticelli painted prominently at Mary’s feet, in the act of bowing to kiss the Child's foot. The other Wise can be identified as Piero and Giovanni de Medici, Cosimo’s two sons. They are kneeling, speaking one each other. Finally, on the left in the painting, there is the portrait of the young Lorenzo il Magnifico, standing, with his hands entwined around the sword, who watches the scene as saying: today is your day, but I am the future.\n\nBotticelli filled the rest of the space with other friends and influential figures from Florence, and among them, on the right, the confident young artist painted himself, looking directly at the viewer. His presence in this painting illustrates a radical shift in the perception of artists during this time period: Botticelli did not view himself as an ordinary craftsman hired for a simple job, he saw himself as a friend to the powerful families of Florence.\n\n[b]by Maddalena Mongera[/b]",

This painting was created in 1917, and thus it may be the culprit behind Modigliani’s failure, as it was the only exhibition he ever held. Unlike his other more elongated forms, the nude body of the woman is graciously painted with flowing curves and a sensual texture; the mask-like face with eyes full of mystery, and a slight smile to the lips. It is not so scandalous and shocking as it is a celebration of the woman’s form and her sensual nature. ",

    "description": "This painting is one of Modigliani’s earlier works, and as such has much more of a traditional look. This painting is also indicative of the artist’s later style in the figure’s elongated neck and the still, somber emotion on her face. There is also much more detail in her clothing and her face than in Modigliani’s later works, which are characterized by simple lines and few discernable features. Early on as an artist, Modigliani preferred life-drawn women subjects, many of whom engaged in love affairs with the handsome painter. One only wonders if this was one such subject. ",

Perhaps the fruity images of summer are best known. For example, in the movie series “Harry Potter,” there is a bowl of fruit at the entrance to a door. Upon requiring entrance, the fruit will sit up, frown, and shake its head no for no entrance allowed, or sit up, smile, and nod its head, allowing entrance into the room.",

    "description": "Kandinsky often related the painting of colors and pictures on a canvas to the composition of beautiful music, and as such, named many of his paintings variants of Composition. His analogy of art as a musical composition revolved around the piano: the eyes were the hammers, the color is the keyboard, and the soul is the piano and strings. Similar to music, which is not just jumbles of notes, Kandinsky’s works were not just amalgamations of non distinct shapes and colors. They were carefully arranged musical elements, precisely proportioned to evoke the maximum aesthetic and emotional response from the viewer.  ",

    "description": "During the summer of 1874, when Monet, Manet and Renoir worked in close proximity to each other, Monet’s first wife Camille most often posed for Manet and Renoir rather than her husband. Two paintings, one by Manet and one by Renoir, done simultaneously on a summer afternoon, capture a moment of peaceful calm in the Monet's garden. In 1924, Monet recounted the circumstances of the day in his garden at Argenteuil: \"Manet, enthralled by the color and the light, undertook an outdoor [url href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436965]painting[/url] of figures under trees. During the sitting, Renoir arrived. . . . He asked me for palette, brush and canvas, and there he was, painting away alongside Manet. The latter was watching him out of the corner of his eye. . . . Then he made a face, passed discreetly near me, and whispered in my ear about Renoir: 'He has no talent, that boy! Since you are his friend, tell him to give up painting!'\" However later, as a celebrator of beauty, and especially feminine sensuality, it has been said that \"Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau\". While many Impressionist painters focused on landscapes, Renoir painted people in intimate and candid moments. Renoir’s works are also notable for their use of vibrant light and color. His style emphasized freely brushed touches of color, so that his figures softly fuse with one another and their surroundings.",

Venus lies, watching Mars sleep, while four young satyrs play around, trying to wake him. In the background is the sea in which Venus was born. There is no exact literary reference for the painting, but the closest legend was in a poem by Poliziano, who in one stanza describes Venus laying down, watching Mars sleep. The Medici family, who commissioned many of Botticelli’s most famous works, were used as models in this painting, the youngest Giuliano di Piero de Medici modeling for the sleeping Mars. ",

The model for the boy in painting was Caravaggio’s good friend Mario Minniti, who was 16 at the time, and who would serve as one of his models many times in the future. As a realist painter, Caravaggio did not idealize his paintings, instead he captured the very essence of what he saw on the canvas in front of him. This is beautifully clear in his portrayals of the fruit and leaves in the basket, which are so realistic that they have been analyzed by horticultural scientists, who were able to accurately determine the individual cultivars.

The picture depicts a young woman on a tree swing, being pushed by her husband. The young woman is clearly flirting with the young man in the foreground, of whom her husband is unaware. The painting was first commissioned to Gabriel Francois Doyen by a young nobleman, to depict him and his mistress. Doyen, of the opinion that the painting was frivolous, refused the commission and passed it on to Fragonard. This painting has influences many later works, from paintings to sculptures, the most recent being the animated feature film Tangled, created in the style of the painting.",

The location appears to be New York as is evident from the yellow bricks in the window.

It created a sensation when it was first exhibited at the Artistic Congress in Antwerp of the same year, and it cemented his growing reputation. According to Alma-Tadema, his teacher Jan August Henrik Leys was accepting of the work, but critical of the marble, which he likened to the texture of cheese. Taking the criticism very seriously, Alma-Tadema spent years perfecting his technique of variegated marble and granite. He became so well known for his realistic marble that he was eventually humorously referred to as a “marbelous painter.”",

    "description": "In this piece, Mondrian’s style is much more fearlessly non-representational. As one of his earlier works, it gives an inkling as to the extent to which the artist was willing to abstract realistic forms in order to suit his own artistic tastes. During the time this painting was created, Mondrian began developing his philosophical ideas on theosophy and anthroposophy, two spiritual movements which allowed Mondrian to see painting as a search for spiritual knowledge within oneself. Although his earlier works depicted dim figures or abstracted colors, his search for spiritual enlightenment within and throughout his paintings was to lead through a pathway of more abstract forms.

    "description": "In his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Period_final-period,resultType:masonry]final period[/url] in the early 1890s, Paul Cézanne created a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Series_card-players,resultType:masonry]series[/url] of five oil paintings that depicted the subject of card players. [i]The Card Players[/i] (1890-1892) at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, is the largest and the most elaborate painting of the series. The Barnes version is a five-figure composition and the only one that includes the figure of the young boy who observes the card game. A more condensed version of this painting is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/the-card-players-1893][i]The Card Players[/i][/url] (1890-1892) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, that has only four figures and a less detailed background. The other three paintings in the series are two-figure compositions, depicting two card players sitting opposite each other.\n\nIt was generally assumed that Cézanne first worked on the multi-figure paintings and then moved on to the simpler compositions featuring only two card players. However, recent technical examinations of the canvases indicate that the opposite was true. Scans revealed that the Metropolitan version was extensively reworked, much more than the larger canvas (135.3 x 181.9) in the Barnes Foundation. Therefore, it seems more likely that Cézanne expanded the composition, adding more figures and elements as he painted the series. Cézanne carefully crafted each painting, basing them on multiple preparatory sketches and figure studies he made of local farmers. For example, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/man-with-a-pipe-study-for-the-card-players-1890][i]Man with a Pipe (Study for The Card Players)[/i][/url] (1890-1892) was a study of the figure leaning against the wall in the paintings from the Barnes Foundation and the Metropolitan Museum.\n\nThe series was the artist’s chief contribution to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/genre-painting]genre painting[/url] – a genre that focused on everyday life, depicting people engaged in mundane activities. Cézanne adopted the motif of card players from 17th century Dutch and French genre paintings, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/card-players][i]Card Players in an Interior[/i][/url] (c. 1660) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen]Jan Steen[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/le-nain-brothers/card-players][i]The Card Players (Les joueurs de cartes)[/i][/url] (c. 1635-1640) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/le-nain-brothers]Le Nain brothers[/url]. In comparison to his predecessors, Cézanne’s paintings lack drama and narrative. Instead, his paintings have a simple setting with subdued figures smoking their pipes and playing cards. Cézanne’s card players show little expression, appearing passive and reserved or immersed in their respective tasks. The artist also limited the facial expressions of the players: their facial features were usually painted in a few strokes that marked their shadowed or downcast eyes.\n\nArt historians also suggest that Cézanne’s composition was influenced by the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance]Renaissance[/url] masters. Possible prototypes include [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/supper-at-emmaus][i]Supper at Emmaus[/i][/url] (c. 1530) and a lost painting by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giovanni-bellini]Giovanni Bellini[/url] of the same subject (c. 1490), that is known through copies and engravings. Similarly, Cézanne used the arrangement of the elements below the tabletop to create a counterpoint to the figures in the composition. This could also reflect the artist’s desire to enhance the everyday scene of card players with the monumentality of a religious subject. Others suggest that Cézanne treated [i]The Card Players[/i] like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_still-life,resultType:masonry]his still life paintings[/url], animating the surface with sequences of color contrasts, that alternate between light and dark, warm and cool hues. In the Barnes version, this is evident in details like the patterned tabletop that is formed through the color contrast between light blue and deep shades of red and violet.",

Shown here is the final version of 'Madonna of the Lilies', one of the murals for the church. The project was cancelled later for unknown reasons, so all that remains of this commission is this painting and earlier versions of it (Sakai City collection, Japan), as well as a design for a stained-glass window,' Harmony', which is also in the Mucha Trust collection.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mucha's letter to his wife Maruška, he conceived the subject as 'Virgo purissima', thus depicting the heavenly vision of Madonna, surrounded with a mass of lilies, symbol of purity. The seated young girl in Slavic folk costume carries a wreath of ivy leaves, symbol of remembrance. Her serious expression and strong physical presence contrast with the ethereal figure of the Virgiin.",

    "description": "John William Waterhouse presented this painting to the Royal Academy after his election as an Academician. From the 1880s Waterhouse exhibited at the Royal Academy and the New Gallery both complex compositions with many figures as well as single figures often taken from literature or Greek mythology. It is possible that Waterhouse's painting of 'A Mermaid' was inspired by Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem 'The Mermaid' (1830) which includes the lines:\nWho would be/\nA mermaid fair/\nSinging alone/\nCombing her hair.\n\nTennyson's poem goes on to describe the mermaid seeking and finding love among the mermen.\n\nOf the bold merry mermen under the sea/\nThey would sue me, and woo me, and flatter me/\nIn the purple twilights under the sea/\nBut the king of them all would carry me/\nWoo me, and win me, and marry me.\n\nHowever Waterhouse was also interested in the darker mythology of the mermaid as an enchantress. Mermaids traditionally were sirens who lured sailors to their death through their captivating song. They were also tragic figures as mermaids could not survive in the human world which they yearned for and men could not exist in their watery realm, so any relationship was doomed. In Waterhouse's painting no sailors are depicted so that despite being a 'siren' the mermaid is shown as an alluring rather lonely figure, albeit with a fish tail. The atmosphere evoked is one of gentle melancholy as the mermaid sits alone in an isolated inlet, dreamily combing out her long hair with her lips parted in song. Beside her is a shell filled with pearls, which some believed to be formed from the tears of dead sailors.\n\nWhen the work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1901 the Art Journal noted her 'wistful-sad look' and the review remarked that 'it tells of the human longings never to be satisfied … The chill of the sea lies ever on her heart; the endless murmur of the waters is a poor substitute for the sound of human voices; never can this beautiful creature, troubled with emotion, experience on the one hand unawakened repose, on the other the joys of womanhood'.",

As Courbet used actual figures for his paintings, it is said that the two women in the painting are his two sisters Zoe and Juliet, and the boy is actually his illegitimate son, Desire Binet. It was first exhibited in 1855 at the Salon of Paris, and later in 1861, when it was purchased for the Musee des Beaux-Arts of Nantes.  ",

    "description": "\"Sugaring Off\" was one of Grandma Moses' most popular themes. Like many of her earliest subjects, it derived from popular illustration—in this case, a well-known Currier & Ives lithograph. Although Moses did at the very start of her career sometimes copy compositions verbatim, she never tried to duplicate this Currier & Ives print. Rather, from the start she freely combined elements from her primary source with vignettes from other sources and from her own imagination. Certain stock images do tend to recur in the \"Sugaring Off\" paintings, however, among them the burning cauldron, the mother pouring maple sugar on the snow (where it would harden into instant candy), the men with buckets, and the little \"sugar house.\"\r\nSugaring Off dates from 1943, at the height of Grandma Moses' first truly mature style. She had by this point in her career gained formidable mastery of her medium. She was capable of rendering details with pristine clarity and of handling extremely complex compositions. Sugaring Off is notable for its vast assortment of disparate activities, arrayed in a preternaturally broad landscape. This opening up of the landscape into an almost square, quiltlike panoply of detail is one of the hallmarks of the \"Grandma Moses style.\" As she matured further, however, Moses would revert to narrower horizontals, which required greater compression of detail.",

    "description": "The Storm on the Sea of Galilee is the only seascape ever painted by Rembrandt. It depicts Jesus calming the waves of the sea, saving the lives of the fourteen men aboard the vessel. Of these fourteen men, it is said Rembrandt included a self portrait of himself in the boat, next to Jesus and his twelve disciples. On March 18, 1990, the painting was stolen by thieves disguised as police officers. They broke into the Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum in Boston, Massachusetts, and stole this painting, along with twelve other works. The paintings have never been recovered, and it is considered the biggest art theft in history. The empty frames of the paintings still hang in their original location, waiting to be recovered. ",

Unlike the many other mistresses of the king, Madame de Pompadour continued to be a presence at the court by creating a cordial relationship with the Queen, by accompanying the King on hunting trips and social gatherings, and commissioning paintings of herself, which hid her aging looks. Although she did commission works from other artists, the majority of her portraits were done by Boucher. ",

Although the model in this painting is unidentified, it may well have been Fragonard’s daughter, who frequently worked as one of his models. Contemporary x-rays have revealed that this painting, depicting a young girl in a sunshine yellow dress, deeply absorbed in her reading, was painted over a different image. As in many of Fragonard’s paintings the viewer gets the impression that he or she is witnessing a private moment, and is at once struck by the beauty and intimacy as well as the desire to give the girl her privacy and let her read.

    "description": "Although Rousseau is most widely known for his jungle motifs, he was also adept at a style of painting that he coined “portrait landscape.” These paintings included a landscape in the background of the painting, and a portrait in the foreground of the piece. This painting includes a forest in the background, which was one of the painting types first produced and displayed by Rousseau, foreshadowing his complex jungle scenes. Critics were initially baffled at the images of the people, who in many cases were strangely costumed, and somehow located in the middle of a large and foreboding forest. This painting is also notable for its lack of perspective, as the entire image is painted in one dimensional pane, as if on a backdrop. ",

After his departure in 1873 back to France was delayed, he decided to paint to pass the time, and intended this painting to be sold to a British textile merchant. But, a worldwide decline in cotton prices made it impossible to make the sale, and he instead exhibited the work in the Impressionist Exhibition in Paris in 1876. In 1878 it was purchased by the Museum of Fine Arts, making it the first sale of one of Degas’ works to a museum. ",

    "description": "This is one of Freud's many paintings of the Australian performance artist Leigh Bowery. Freud's friends introduced them, hoping that Bowery's flamboyant style, which included bright colors and sequins, would inspire Freud to abandon his usual drab palette. Being obstinate, Freud asked Bowery to shave his whole body. Freud saw Bowery's muscular legs as his best feature, and often showcases them in a series of unusually unselfconscious and passive poses that thwart the conventions of male portraiture.\n\nIn Man with Leg Up, Bowery lies on the floor with his legs splayed. One leg rests on the bed while the other bends underneath him, as if keeping him from sliding down the floor, which tilts toward us. Nearly all elements in this scene, from the supine pose to the splayed legs indicates vulnerability. Exaggerated foreshortening makes Bowery's top half appear further away, highlighting the exposure of his hairless groin, which occupies the very center of the picture. Bowery seems at ease with this. His facial features are relaxed. His left arm cradles his head while his right is draped across his chest, regarding us as if to say, \"so what\"?\n\nThe two men developed a friendship, and Freud continued to paint Bowery over the course of four years, until his death from AIDS in 1994.",

The stark canvas on White on White it is not devoid of emotion or deep artistic sentiment.

Although he used the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War as a pretence to move to England, it is thought that he actually moved to London to be closer to Laura. Upon his arrival, he contracted with Laura for private art lessons, and thereafter asked her to marry him. Although her father originally refused due to their age difference (she was 18, he was 34), he relented on the condition that the two got to know each other first. Apparently the match was good, as they stayed married for the rest of their lives. Alma-Tadema used his wife, Laura Therese Alma-Tadema, who was a painter in her own right, as a model in many of his paintings, The Women of Amphissa of which is the most prominent example.   ",

    "description": "Degas’ early masterpiece, The Bellelli Family depicts his aunt, her husband and their two little girls. It is believed that the artist drew each of the figures individually, later combining them in this unique portrayal of their family dynamic. The woman, Degas’ aunt Laura, wears a black dress in mourning for her recently deceased father, whose portrait hangs on the wall behind her. It is likely that this portrait hung at the Paris Salon of 1867, but it was badly hung and as a result was largely ignored by the critics. As a result, Degas kept it in his personal collection, where it remained until he left it to his dealer in 1913. In 1918, after his death, it was revealed an exhibition of the artist’s estate, and was immediately bought for 400,000 by the Luxembourg Museum. ",

The scene is of a Sunday afternoon at Moulin de la Galette, where Parisians would typically dress up and spend all day dancing, drinking, and eating galettes, or flat cakes. The painting was in the collection of Gustave Caillebotte, but it was claimed by the French government upon his death due to the non payment of death duties. It was later transferred from the Luxembourg Museum, to the Louvre, and then later to the Musee d’Orsay. Its sale price at auction in 2009 was the fifth highest price ever paid for a painting at auction. ",

    "description": "This is the second (and most known) version of the Unexpected Visitors. The first one was painted by Repin in 1883; it was significantly smaller both by size and by quantity of personages (the main character was a girl accompanied by a woman and two more girls, supposedly her mother and sisters). \r\nBefore long, Repin started to paint the second version. He worked in his country house not far from St.Petersburg; the room portrayed in the picture was artist’s living room. As models for female characters, he used his wife, mother-in-law, and his daughter.\r\nIn a year Unexpected Visitors was exposed in a Traveling Art Exhibition. However, the artist continued to improve this picture within next four years. In particularly, he repainted the face of the young man (a political exile who unexpectedly came back home) four times in search of a proper expression. It is generally believed that by depicting various reaction of young man’s household Repin tried to show diverse but mostly positive attitude of society toward revolutionary movements of that time. Actually, under strict censorship of Czarist Russia, it was a political declaration disguised as an everyday genre scene. ",

    "description": "The monumental painting [i]Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?[/i] (1897-98) was created in Tahiti during a time of the artist's great personal crisis. Struggling to find recognition and success in Paris, Gauguin decided to move permanently to Tahiti in 1895. There he continued to struggle: plagued by illness and mounting debt, his mental health rapidly deteriorated. Around the same time, he learned that his beloved daughter Aline died of pneumonia. At this low point, he summoned his strength to paint [i]Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?[/i], a masterpiece that was a summation of his artistic ideas. He wrote: “I have put all my energy into it one more time before I die, so painful a passion in such dreadful circumstances, so clear and accurate a vision, that there is no trace of precociousness and life blossoms forth from it”.\n\nThe painting, which should be viewed from right to left, represents the spectrum of human activity throughout one’s life, from birth to death. The thread of the composition corresponds with the questions posed in the title of the painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? The boundaries of the scene are marked by the newborn child lying in the grass on the right, and the haggard old woman, who glumly reflects on the past. Between these two, Gauguin creates a dreamlike vision that describes the daily existence of adulthood. In the background, he included a couple walking and an exotic blue idol, which, according to Gauguin, symbolized ‘the Beyond'. The large canvas features some of Gauguin’s favorite subjects, such as the reclining nude, the group of figures lost in thought, and the cult statue.\n\nThe painting expressed Gauguin’s highly personal mythology, which was developed through the combination and adaption of symbols from a variety of Western and non-Western sources. In particular, the scene reflects the influence of Tahiti, its tropical landscape, and native Polynesian culture. Gauguin wanted the painting to evoke associative meanings, rather than explain explicitly the meaning of his symbolism. His symbolism expressed the inner world of visions and emotions, which was purposefully enigmatic and ambiguous. Gauguin wanted to interpret life as a great mystery, and in the painting, he emphasized the lack of understanding of the world.\n\nAfter he completed the painting, Gauguin sent it to Paris to the art collector George-Daniel de Monfreid. Shortly after the artist retreated to the hills where he intended to poison himself by drinking arsenic. Gauguin’s suicide attempt failed, and he gradually recovered in the hospital. In the meantime, Monfried managed to sell the painting for a thousand francs, something that helped Gauguin’s spirits. Today the painting is part of the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.",

    "description": "At the beginning of World War I, Klee felt distanced from the event and it affected him very little. However, after his two friends Marc and Macke both died in the conflict, the effects of the war began to take hold on his consciousness. He used art as an outlet for his distress, creating a series of lithographs of war scenes. In Death for the Idea, we see a body lying at the bottom of a series of lines and shapes, building up above him like a cityscape. Klee joined the war effort, but was spared battle, as he was employed instead as a clerk, as well as to paint camouflage on airplanes. He was also able to paint throughout the war and his work was included in many exhibits. ",

    "description": "This painting depicts the burial of Courbet’s great uncle in the small French town of Ornans, and it is considered to be one of the turning points in French art. The painting depicted the scene with an unflattering air, and it did not romanticize the depictions of grief and mourning, as in traditional Romantic paintings. Critics of the piece decried both the style of the painting as well as the size. At 10 feet tall by 22 feet wide, the size of the canvas was typically reserved for religious or heroic scenes, and the painting critics said was intentionally ugly and harsh. For the subjects in the painting, Courbet also used the real people who had actually been at the burial, rather than actors used as models for the art. As it had such a deleterious effect on the Romantic style of painting, it could also be easily called “The Burial of Romanticism,” as Courbet himself said: “The Burial at Ornans was in reality the burial of Romanticism.”\r\n\r\nThis 22 foot long canvas situated in a main room at the Musee d'Orsay buries the viewer as if he or she were in a cave. In a decidedly non-classical composition, figures mill about in the darkness, unfocused on ceremony. As a prime example of Realism, the painting sticks to the facts of a real burial and avoids amplified spiritual connotations. Emphasizing the temporal nature of life, Courbet intentionally did not let the light in the painting express the eternal. While sunset could have expressed the great transition of the soul from the temporal to the eternal, Courbet covered the evening sky with clouds so the passage of day into night is just a simple echo of the coffin passing from light into the dark of the ground. Some critics saw the adherence to the strict facts of death as slighting religion and criticized it as a shabbily composed structure with worn-faced working folk raised up to life-size in a gigantic work as if they had some kind of noble importance. Other critics such as Proudhon loved the inference of equality and virtue of all people and recognized how such a painting could help turn the course of Western art and politics.",

For four decades after World War II, this painting was considered lost. It was found when it was put on display at the Hermitage Museum in Russia, where it still remains. It was later discovered that the Russians had seized the painting from the collections of Otto Gerstenberg during the Soviet occupation of Germany following World War II. The composition, with a large amount of negative space, is thought by art historians to be based off of a photograph, which was an interest of Degas’ in his later life. ",

It is not a true representation of the landscape of Toledo, however. Although the castle is in the correct place, the rest of the buildings are not truly represented in location or distance to each other.

As the tale goes, once, Sardanapalus learned he was facing military defeat, he ordered all his possessions destroyed, including his many concubines, servants and animals, before he committed suicide. This painting beautifully exemplifies the Romantic themes of bold colors, tragic imagery, and exotic decor. Delacroix used many literary sources as inspiration, including Shakespeare, Goethe and Byron, whom Delacroix largely admired. The Sardanapalus theme also inspired a cantata by Hector Berlioz and an opera by Franz Liszt.",

    "description": "[i]The Portrait of Pablo Picasso[/i] (1912) by Juan Gris is considered one of the finest portraits of the cubist art movement. The portrait depicts [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url], one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, who founded [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/cubism]Cubism[/url] together with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-braque]Georges Braque[/url]. Picasso was a defining figure in Gris’s artistic development, and the painting honors him as a mentor. In 1906, Gris moved to Paris and settled in the Montmartre neighborhood. Soon after, he met Picasso, who introduced him to the leading painters, poets, and critics of the new generation like Braque, Guillaume Apollinaire, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/max-jacob]Max Jacob[/url], Maurice Raynal, and Pierre Reverdy. In his first years in Paris, Gris worked as a graphic artist, drawing illustrations for various political and satirical magazines. Influenced by his environment, he began to paint seriously in 1910, and the following year he decided to fully devote his time to painting. In a relatively short period of time, Gris began producing works comparable in quality to those of his older and more experienced colleagues.\n\nGris decided to make his artistic debut with [i]The Portrait of Pablo Picasso[/i] at the 1912 Salon of Independent Artists. Gris depicts Picasso as a painter, holding a palette in his hand. The inscription at the bottom right of the painting, “Hommage à Pablo Picasso” exhibits Gris’s respect for Picasso as a leader and innovator. The portrait draws from [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/analytical-cubism]Analytical Cubism[/url], the early phase of Cubism that lasted from 1908 to 1912. The term Analytical Cubism describes the analytical approach to the subject matter: the artist deconstructs the subject by depicting it simultaneously from multiple points of view. In the portrait, Gris deconstructed the figure by fracturing the head, neck, and torso into various planes and geometric shapes. Gris created a very organized composition with a regulated structure of diagonals. The painting has limited to a palette of cool tones of blue, brown, and grey. This was also characteristic of Analytic Cubism because a simplified color palette further emphasized the structure of the forms. What distinguished the portrait was the contrast produced by the blues, browns, and grey that gave the colors a luminous quality.\n\nThe painting was also an homage to Picasso as an artist, and more specifically it relates to the portraits Picasso painted in 1910: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-ambroise-vollard-1910][i]Portrait of Ambroise Vollard[/i][/url] (1910), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-daniel-henry-kahnweiler-1910][i]Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler[/i][/url] (1910), and [[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-wilhelm-uhde-1910]i]Portrait of Wilhelm Uhde[/i][/url] (1910). [i]The Portrait of Pablo Picasso[/i] was also linked to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-metzinger/le-go-ter-1911][i]Tea Time[/i][/url] (1911), a portrait by French painter and theorist, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-metzinger]Jean Metzinger[/url]. According to some scholars, Gris was so impressed by [i]Tea Time[/i] that he became convinced of the importance of mathematics, and the two paintings have a similar grid structure. [i]The Portrait of Pablo Picasso[/i] was an artistic homage to Picasso’s innovations, who with Georges Braque paved the way for other Cubist painters like Gris. At the same time, the painting showed Gris’s artistic skill and maturity and is considered one of his early artistic achievements.\n",

    "description": "Another of Monet’s series of paintings, the Poplar paintings were painted in the summer and fall of 1891. The poplars trees were located on the banks of a river a few miles up the river from Monet’s home in Giverny, France, in a marsh. Monet had to reach his painting studio, which was floating outside along the bank of the trees, by going upriver in a small boat. The trees that were the subject of the paintings were actually put up for sale by the city of Limetz, who owned them, and Monet actually bought the trees so he could continue his paintings of them. After his series was finished, he sold the trees to a lumber company who wanted them for harvest. ",
