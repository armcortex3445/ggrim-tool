    "description": "One of El Greco’s earlier works, The Dormition of the Virgin was not attributed to him until 1983, when his signature was discovered at the bottom of the painting. This discovery led to the attribution of more of his earlier works, including Modena Triptych and Adoration of the Magi. The discovery of this piece as an El Greco painting has led to insights on his artistic style and subject matter. Painted in the Byzantine manner, this painting suggests that the artist changed his painting style in order to fit the subject matter and other requirements of the painting, including the desired location.

    "description": "One of Corot’s poetic masterpieces, this painting is one of most successful works. As it incorporates the realistic elements of a real world image, but romanticize in such a way as to create a dreamlike image, Corot’s work can be seen as a bridge between Realism and Impressionism. In the 1860’s Corot became interested in the art of photography, and this is apparent in the way this painting is presented, as it resembles an early blurry landscape photograph. Unlike most landscape paintings, this one was not created from real life, but from Corot’s remembrance of the ways in which the light played off the water and leaves of the trees. ",

Giotto shows off his talent by draping the clothing lightly over the crucified Jesus, whose loincloth lightly sits upon his body, and drapes down across his legs as his body sinks down on the cross.

Each has the same title, Et in Arcadia Ego, engraved on the tomb, which in Latin roughly translates as “I exist even in Arcadia,” as if it is spoken by the dead. Other interpretations of the saying state that the inscription on the tomb simply reads “I was an Arcadian.” Either way, this painting, in a more Baroque style reminiscent of his earlier works, remains one of Poussin’s most influential paintings. It has also inspired a documentary about the painting entitled In Arcadia, surrounding the Poussin painting. ",

    "description": "[i]The Concert[/i] is another painting by Vermeer that deals with the theme of music. The three figures form a music ensemble; they play, keep time and sing in harmony. Music functions as a metaphor for harmony in love, and Vermeer’s intimate, quiet scene embodies qualities of moderation and harmony. The setting, furniture and clothes help identify the music players as members of the upper classes. The man playing the lute, for instance, wears an intricate sash and sword, symbols of social status. [i]The Concert[/i] also shares commonalities with Vermeer’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-music-lesson][i]The music lesson[/i][/url] (ca. 1662-1665), another painting in which music is a central theme. For example, in both paintings, Vermeer chose to include the bass viol in the foreground. The additional instrument is a way to amplify the idea of shared pleasure and potential harmony in music and love.\n\nThe element of a picture within a picture is recurring in Vermeer’s artwork. Generally speaking, many artists used the picture presented in the background as a way to relate to the central theme of the painting.  In [i]The Concert[/i], there are two painting hanging in on the back wall behind the players. On the left side hangs a pastoral [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/landscape#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]landscape[/url] painting that relates to the landscape painted on the lid of the harpsichord. The second painting on the right side is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dirck-van-baburen]Dirck van Baburen[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dirck-van-baburen/the-procuress-1622][i]The Procuress[/i][/url] (1622). Baburen was an important figure of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/utrecht-school#!#resultType:masonry]Utrecht Caravaggisti[/url], a group of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque#!#resultType:masonry]Baroque[/url] artists influenced by the art of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio]Caravaggio[/url], that were mainly based in the Dutch city of Utrecht. [i]The Procuress[/i] depicts a brothel scene, a popular subject in Dutch [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/genre-painting#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]genre painting[/url]. Baburen’s painting is also a composition of three figures: the prostitute, the customer and the procuress. The scene in [i]The Procuress[/i] offers a thematic contrast to Vermeer’s ensemble. While in Baburen’s painting music is associated with illicit love, Vermeer’s musical trio embodies the ideals of harmony and moderation.  [i]The Procuress[/i] also appears in the background of another painting by Vermeer, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/a-young-woman-seated-at-a-virginal-a-lady-seated-at-a-virginal][i]A young woman seated at a virginal[/i][/url] (ca.1670-1672), which was painted approximately six years after [i]The Concert[/i]. There are at least three versions of Baburen’s painting, one of which belonged to Vermeer’s mother in-law, Maria Thins, who owned a collection of art produced by Utrecht Caravaggisti painters.\n\nThe first documentation of [i]The Concert[/i] was only in 1780. The painting was acquired in 1892 by art patron and collector, Isabella Stewart Gardner at the auction of Théophile Thoré-Bürger collection. Thoré-Bürger was a French art critic and journalist, who played a key role in the rediscovery of the works of Jan Vermeer in the 19th century.  [i]The Concert[/i] was one of the first Vermeer’s to be brought to the United States, and was exhibited in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. In 1990, [i]The Concert[/i] was one of thirteen artworks stolen from the museum, and it has yet to be recovered.",

    "description": "The Feast of the Gods is an oil painting by Giovanni Bellini, with substantial additions by Titian, who added all the landscape to the left and centre. It is one of a cycle of paintings on mythological subjects produced for Alfonso I d'Este, the Duke of Ferrara, for his camerino d'alabastro ('chamber of alabaster') in the Castello Estense, Ferrara. It is one of the few mythological pictures by Bellini, who completed it in 1514. After his death soon afterwards (1516), Titian probably modified the landscape on the left to match it to his The Bacchanal of the Andrians (1518–1523), also in Alfonso's camerino. A more thorough reworking in about 1529 added more landscape, adding the mountain behind the figures.\r\n\r\nThe scene depicted conflates two episodes in Ovid's Fasti. Priapus, on the right, is attempting to seduce the sleeping nymph Lotis, but is prevented from success by the bray of Silenus' donkey. Around are the drunken Gods: Jupiter has an eagle next to him, Poseidon is caressing Cybele and Ceres, while Hermes is languidly lying on a barrel. The boy with vine-leaves on his head is an unusually young depiction of Bacchus. It is thought that Bellini initially painted the figures as mortals, following a misleading translation of Ovid (the so-called Ovidio volgarizzato), and had to re-paint them with the attributes of the Olympian gods.",

    "description": "This enigmatic painting is part of Picabia's Transparency series (c.1928-31), whose dream-like quality derives from layers of imagery that faintly suggest strange narratives. Though the title of this painting is Adam et Eve (Adam and Eve), it was inspired by Orestes and Electra, a classical Greek sculpture in the Museum of Naples, which portrays Electra and her brother considering revenge on their mother and stepfather for the murder of their father, Agamemnon. Classical subjects such as this were popular in the interwar period, yet most artists attempted to give new life to Classicism by adapting it to modern times. Picabia refuses this temptation, instead leaving the statue enigmatically layered with a smiling face and leaving us with a mystery. This clash of imagery from apparently different sources would be a major inspiration for later artists such as Sigmar Polke. ",

Dr. Gachet had been referred to van Gogh by Camille Pissarro. He treated mainly artists, and was an amateur artist himself. Van Gogh’s first impression of the man was that he was sicker than Van Gogh himself. He completed at least three works of the good doctor, all of which depicted his somber mood and melancholic stance. In 1990, the painting received $82.5 million at auction, a record-breaking price, which continues to be one of the highest prices ever paid for a painting at auction. ",

    "description": "[i]Knight, Death and the Devil[/i] (1513), is one of Dürer’s most famous and most complex artworks that has been subject to much debate among art historians. At the heart of the controversy is the figure of the knight, and his symbolic function and meaning. Frequently, Dürer’s knight was interpreted as a symbol of moral virtue, an embodiment of the ideal of the ‘Christian Knight’. Following this interpretation the knight is a stoic figure, unfazed by the devil and the monsters that try to entice him. The knight is protected by his armor, and accompanied by his dog, a symbol of loyalty. Some have tied the conception of the engraving to the [i]Handbook of a Christian Knight[/i], written by the Dutch humanist, Erasmus of Rotterdam. It was also suggested that the knight could have been modeled after several historical figures, including Martin Luther, Pope Julius II and Franz von Sickingen, a German knight and important figure of the early period of the Reformation.\n\nHowever, more recent studies challenge the interpretation of the ‘Christian Knight’, pointing out that it overlooks the social and political context of Dürer’s time. Historical documentation refers to the phenomena of Robber Knights, who attacked and louted dealers and merchants, threatening trade and finances of cities such as Nuremberg (Dürer’s place of birth and principal place of residence). Evidence of Dürer’s contempt for these figures may exist in an earlier artwork, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/death-and-the-landsknecht-1510][i]Death and Landsknecht[/i][/url] (1510). In the 1510 woodcut, Death confronts the indifferent Knight, who appears unconcerned by the ominous encounter. The woodcut is accompanied by a poem written by the artist, in which he warns those who do not pay their dues in this life. If indeed the knight in [i]Knight, Death and the Devil[/i] is a ‘Robber Knight’, the devil and death are not his adversaries, but rather his companions. In this case, the knight could be seen as passive or compliant. The contrary interpretations of the knight also impact the analysis of other details in the engraving, such as the foxtail attached to the tip of the knight’s lance. In the context of the ‘Christian Knight’ interpretation, the foxtail can be seen as a good luck charm. In contrast, according to the ‘Robber Knight’ analysis, the foxtail can symbolize the trickery and the cunning nature of the fox.   \n\nAnother focal element in the engraving is the Knight’s horse, which was conceived with impressive anatomical accuracy. It is proposed that the pose of the knight and horse was inspired by Italian equestrian statues, particularly by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrochio]Andrea del Verrochio[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrochio/equestrian-statue-of-bartolomeo-colleoni][i]Equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni[/i][/url] (1480-1488), in Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice. Because of his travels to Venice, Dürer was certainly familiar with the statue. Likewise, parallels can be made with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci]Leonardo Da Vinci[/url]’s preparatory [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/study-for-the-sforza-monument-1489]drawings for the equestrian monument of Francesco Sforza[/url]. Another identified source of influence is Dürer’s contemporary, German Renaissance painter, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/lucas-cranach-the-elder]Lucas Cranach the Elder[/url]. Cranach’s woodcut, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/lucas-cranach-the-elder/knight-in-armor-riding-toward-the-right-1506][i]Knight in Armor Riding toward the Right[/i][/url] (1506), demonstrates similarities in the position of the horse, the gloomy figure of the knight and the elements in the backdrop, the castle on the hill. Therefore, Dürer seems to successfully adapt a variety of sources, the robust proportions of Italian equestrian statues together with northern influences, such as Cranach’s woodcut.",

    "description": "Sidonia von Bork is the central character in Wilhelm Meinhold's gothic romance 'Sidonia the Sorceress'. The novel is set in sixteenth-century Pomerania and chronicles the crimes of the evil Sidonia, whose beauty captivates all who see her. She is shown here at the court of the dowager Duchess of Wolgast, one of the early intrigues in a career that leads to her execution as a witch. Many of the details of Sidonia's appearance are taken directly from Meinhold's description, but the costume is derived from a portrait of Isabella d'Este by Giulio Romano at Hampton Court. This is one of three figure studies, which were the earliest watercolours Burne-Jones completed.\n\nGallery label, August 2004",

Hopper created this work based on an experience in Greenwich, NY, in which he takes an early morning walk. The painting reflects his deep interest in being alone with his thoughts. It's an ambiguous scene as key details such as road signs are left out - it could be anywhere in the United States. A barbers shop is the only sign of business or even any life within the area. This painting is an example of his striking use of light to create an ethereal mood. It is stark and efficient and conveys a sense of desolation, yet the lighting softens these characteristics.",

    "description": "''Grande Odalisque'', also known as ''Une Odalisque or La Grande Odalisque'', completed in 1814, is a Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres oil painting depicting an odalisque or concubine. It is currently housed in the Louvre, Paris.\n\nThe painting was commissioned by Napoleon's sister, Queen Caroline Murat of Naples. Ingres drew for inspiration upon such works as Dresden Venus by Giorgione, and Titian's Venus of Urbino, though the actual pose of a reclining figure looking back over her shoulder is directly drawn from the 1809 Portrait of Madame Récamier by Jacques-Louis David. The small head, elongated limbs, and cool color scheme all reveal influences from Mannerists such as Parmigianino, whose Madonna with the Long Neck was also well known for its anatomical distortion.\n\nThis eclectic mix of styles, combining classical form with Romantic themes, prompted harsh criticism when it was first shown in 1814. Ingres' contemporaries believed it marked Ingres' break from Neoclassicism, indicating a shift toward exotic Romanticism. Ingres' critics viewed him as a rebel against the contemporary style of form and content. When the painting was first shown in the Salon of 1819, a critic remarked that the work had \"neither bones nor muscle, neither blood, nor life, nor relief, indeed nothing that constitutes imitation\". This echoed the general view that Ingres had disregarded anatomical realism. Ingres instead favored long lines to convey curvature and sensuality, as well as abundant even light to tone down the volume. Ingres continued to be attacked for his work until the mid-1820s.\n\nStemming from the initial criticism the painting received, the figure in Grande Odalisque is thought to be drawn with \"two or three vertebrae too many.\" Critics at the time believed the elongations to be errors on the part of Ingres, but recent studies show the elongations to have been deliberate. Measurements taken on the proportions of real women showed that Ingres's figure was drawn with a curvature of the spine and rotation of the pelvis impossible to replicate. It also showed the left arm of the odalisque is shorter than the right. The study concluded that the figure was longer by five instead of two or three vertebrae and that the excess affected the lengths of the pelvis and lower back instead of merely the lumbar region.\n\nGiven how the duty of concubines was merely to satisfy the carnal pleasures of the sultan, this elongation of her pelvic area may have been a symbolic distortion by Ingres. While this may represent sensuous feminine beauty, her gaze, on the other hand, has been said to \"[reflect] a complex psychological make-up\" or \"[betray] no feeling\". In addition, the distance between her gaze and her pelvic region may be a physical representation of the depth of thought and complex emotions of a woman's thoughts and feelings.",

    "description": "One of the most celebrated British paintings is the portrait [i]The Blue Boy[/i] (c. 1770) by Thomas Gainsborough. The painting shows a boy dressed in a 17th-century costume, an homage to the Flemish master [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck]Anthony van Dyck[/url]. The dress and gestures in [i]The Blue Boy[/i] echo van Dyck’s portraits of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck/charles-ii-as-child-1637][i]Charles II as a child[/i][/url] (1637), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck/the-five-eldest-children-of-charles-i-1637][i]The Children of King Charles I of England[/i][/url] (1637) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck/portrait-of-charles-ii-when-prince-of-wales][i]Charles II as Prince of Wales, in Armor[/i][/url] (c. 1637-1638). These types of portraits were usually not commissions, instead, they served as intellectual exercises that allowed portrait painters to experiment, to show off their painterly skills and mastery. Gainsborough demonstrates his artistry in his treatment of the brooding landscape in the background, and the satin fabric costume in which he experiments with the play of light and shadow on the garment.\n\nIt has been said that Gainsborough painted [i]The Blue Boy[/i] because of his rivalry with fellow portrait painter, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joshua-reynolds]Sir Joshua Reynolds[/url]. In his writings, Reynolds stated that cool colors should not dominate the foreground, rather they should be used in small amounts to set off the warm colors in the painting. However, this story was likely invented to play up the rivalry between the painters: [i]The Blue Boy[/i] was exhibited in 1770, and Reynolds made this remark in 1778. Still, it is worth noting that the two painters held opposed artistic beliefs: while Reynolds was very stern and advocated for the study of old masters, Gainsborough was more spontaneous and modern in his approach. \n\nBecause he was the owner of the painting, it was widely believed that the sitter in the painting was Jonathan Buttall, the son of a wealthy hardware merchant. However, this identification was never confirmed and recently art historian Susan Sloman suggested the sitter could be Gainsborough Dupont, the artist’s nephew. Dupont lived with Gainsborough’s family in Bath and London and was the painter’s one and only resident apprentice and assistant. Gainsborough painted his nephew’s portrait in a similar costume on two other occasions: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/dupont][i]Gainsborough Dupont[/i][/url] (1770-1772) in the Tate collection and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/gainsborough-dupont-1773][i]Gainsborough Dupont[/i][/url] (1773) in the Rothschild collection. The two portraits of Dupont demonstrate a physical resemblance to the sitter in [i]The Blue Boy[/i]. In the Rothschild portrait, Dupont even wears a blue frock like the one worn by [i]The Blue Boy[/i]. Furthermore, x-rays of the painting show that originally Gainsborough painted a dog next to the boy. The dog, an English water spaniel was likely Tristram, one of the Gainsborough’s family pets, making it more likely that the artist was painting a family member.\n\nThe painting belonged to Jonathan Buttall until he filed for bankruptcy in 1796. From that point, it changed several owners: initially it was bought by politician John Nesbitt, later, in 1802, by painter John Hoppner, and in 1809, it entered the collection of Earl Grosvenor. During this period, [i]The Blue Boy[/i] was featured in multiple exhibitions: it became beloved by the public and was widely reproduced in print. In 1921, the iconic painting was sold to American railroad magnate Henry Edward Huntington for £182,200 – a record price at the time. The sale caused public outcry so before it was shipped to California, it was briefly displayed at The National Gallery. [i]The Blue Boy[/i] was seen by 90,000 people, and The National Gallery director Charles Holmes even made an emotional gesture by scrawling the words “Au Revoir, C.H” on the back of the canvas. Today, the painting is in the Huntington Library, San Marino, California.",

This particular painting was one of many that the artist produced for the Cahen d’Anvers family, and depicted the girls when they were five and six years old. The original commission was to paint each of the girls separately, but after the eldest daughter was painted by herself, the decision was made to paint the two younger girls together. Elisabeth, the eldest in the painting, had a tragic destiny. Although her sister lived until the ripe age of 89, she was sent to Auschwitz concentration camp due to her Jewish descent, and died at the age of 69 on the way to the concentration camp.",

The fantastical images are typical of Bosch’s nightmarish style, complete with imps, monsters, and dysmorphic creatures.

It was first designed as an image for a tapestry in 1748, and was one in a set of six images depicting Noble Pastorales. Originally, tapestries were woven directly over the paintings, and later, they were cut up into sections to be sold separately. Fortunately this one was spared such a fate, and it is now in the collection of The Getty Center of Los Angeles. ",

The images in the paintings reflect a philosophical interpretation of the outside world, depicting the power and might of nature. As well as the four seasons, they also revolve through the four times of day: early morning, midday, evening, and moonlight.

    "description": "[i]The Sower[/i] is Millet's most famous theme and one he repeated several times between 1850 and 1870. For Millet, the subject expressed profound personal and religious beliefs. However, his first version (now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) aroused a storm of controversy when it appeared in the 1850 Paris Salon. Viewers were shocked by Millet's heroic treatment of a lowly peasant at a time when the situation of the French rural poor was degrading, and socialism threatened bourgeois society. The latter version of this painting is now in the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; and lithographic version is in the MET, NY. \n\nMillet was the artist that van Gogh most revered. Although he never saw Millet’s famous [i]Sower[/i] - already in a Boston collection before he was born - van Gogh admired Millet’s other treatments of the theme, and sought to emulate them.",

    "description": "A diminutive 23 by 32 inches, this painting has been called the best small painting in the world. The subject and composition of the painting is unusual, and the iconography in the painting has been subject to much conjecture. The painting illustrates the flagellation of Christ in an open courtyard, while three unidentified men stand indifferent in the foreground. The small painting is lauded for the use of linear perspective, by portraying the men in the background at a smaller size than those in the foreground of the painting. Many interpretations surround the work, and most are focused on the three men in the foreground of the painting, who are unidentified. Theories range from the men being men of note in Piero’s time, to Pontius Pilate and other Jews, and an angel flanks by and emperor and young man. ",

    "description": "Troy, which lies across the Hudson River from Albany, New York, was the largest city near Grandma Moses' home in Eagle Bridge. Surviving documents suggest that, for a brief period before she married, the future artist did factory work in Troy.\r\nA massive fire in Troy two years after Moses' birth clearly figured prominently in local lore. Moses cut out and saved a commemorative news clipping, published in 1939, and used it as the basis for a series of paintings. The artist's pencil notations on the clipping indicate how she proposed to modify the vignette. The Burning of Troy in 1862, the fifth version she did of the subject, is already quite far removed from the clipping.\r\nConventional illustration tends to focus on foreground or background, but seldom on both at once. Combining these two views was one hallmark of the \"Grandma Moses\" style. Thus, in The Burning of Troy Moses has considerably expanded the scene beyond the burning bridge, including more foreground as well as a detailed rendering of the city in the background.",

    "description": "Although he created many serious works for epic poems by great authors, Dore also illustrated many fairy tales, including Little Red Riding Hood and Cendrillon, or Cinderella. The story of Cinderella was just as much a cultural influence in the 19th century as it is today, as it is a story of unjust circumstances and the human ability to hope that magic can help us overcome those circumstances. It was in the 19th century that the Brother’s Grimm wrote the version of the story that was widely popular at the time. Their large compilation of their fairy tales was first published in 1812, and numerous editions followed the first for the next throughout the 19th century, all of which were extensively illustrated, including works from Gustave Dore.",

    "description": "Unlike many other artists of his period, who painted in only one area of composition, Cezanne was adept at many areas of composition, including landscapes, still lifes, nude studies, and portraits. The artist completed many portraits, often using models from real life as his guides, this one possibly being his wife. He employed a light style that was related to his direct observation of his subject, as indicated by the lightly amused look on her face and her engaged posture. This painting is also indicative of his use of small color planes. Rather than completing the painting with realistic depth and shadow, he illustrates the figure as if she is in a singular dimension, employing the use of one color for each area of the composition.

Although the exact date of the painting is not known, it is thought to be of his early career, as it exhibits the “light painting” technique of Francesca’s teacher, Domenico Veneziano. The painting illustrates Christ being baptized by John, and three angels are standing to the left of the tree, with hands held, symbolizing the unification of the Eastern and Western Churches. Francesca’s knowledge and execution of geometry can be seen in John’s arm and leg, both of which are two angles of the same size. ",

    "description": "This work is one of the mysteries of European painting: in spite of its undeniable quality and epochal importance, opinions are divergent concerning both its creator and its theme. It is the outstanding masterpiece of the Venetian Renaissance, the summit of Giorgione's creative career, so much so that according to some it may have been painted, or at least finished, by Titian rather than Giorgione.\r\n\r\nThe painting has been interpreted as an allegory of Nature, similar to Giorgione's Storm, which was undeniably painted by him; it was even viewed as the first example of the modern herdsman genre. Its message must be more complex than this. It is likely that the master consciously unified several themes in this painting, and the deciphering of symbols required a degree of erudition even at the time of its creation. During the eighteenth century the painting was known by the simple name of \"Pastorale\" and only subsequently was it given the title \"Fête champêtre\" or \"Concert champêtre\", owing to its festive mood. Modern research has pointed out that the composition is in fact an allegory of poetry.\r\n\r\nThe female figures in the foreground are probably the Muses of poetry, their nakedness reveals their divine being. The standing figure pouring water from a glass jar represents the superior tragic poetry, while the seated one holding a flute is the Muse of the less prestigious comedy or pastoral poetry. The well-dressed youth who is playing a lute is the poet of exalted lyricism, while the bareheaded one is an ordinary lyricist. The painter based this differentiation on Aristotle's \"Poetica\".\r\n\r\nThe scenery is characterized by a duality. Between the elegant, slim trees on the left, we see a multi-levelled villa, while on the right, in a lush grove, we see a shepherd playing a bagpipe. Yet the effect is completely unified. The very presence of the beautiful, mature Muses provides inspiration; the harmony of scenery and figures, colours and forms proclaims the close interrelationship between man and nature, poetry and music.",

    "description": "Bosch’s symbolic genius is hard at work in this painting. It used to be thought that a stone was the cause of madness, and if removed, it would cure the individual of insanity or folly. The stone was removed through trepidation, or drilling a whole into an individual’s skull and literally removing the “stone.” Bosch’s play on the imagery in the painting is beyond literal. The person performing the procedure is wearing a funnel hat, which at the time meant he was a charlatan, and the woman wears a book on her head, which also suggests folly. Combined, the images are a satire on madness and folly, as they depict a ridiculous scene, filled with symbolism of the nonsensical. ",

Although its social message was crystal clear in its portrayal of the inhumane working conditions faced by the barge haulers, the work was bought by the Emperor’s second son, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, and exhibited all throughout Europe as an example of Russian realist painting. The work was wildly popular, and it has been parodied throughout Russia, and used as the basis for political cartoons. It was also the inspiration for the popular Russian song “The Song of the Volga Boatmen.”",

    "description": "Beginning in 1909, Bakst worked mainly as a set and costume designer, creating elaborate stage designs and flowing costumes for the dancers. He quickly became well-known for the productions of Sergei Diaghilev, with whom he co-founded the Ballet Russes, a ballet production group. With Diaghilev, he produced elaborate costumes and designs for Cleopatra, Scheherazade, Carnaval, Narcisse, La Spectre de la Rose, and Daphnis et Chloe. Although he was Russian-born, due to his Jewish religion he could not obtain a residency card to live in St Petersburg. He was thus forced to live in the “pale of settlement,” in France, and completed all of these ballet productions between the years of 1909 and 1912. He continued to design for the stage until shortly before his death in 1924. ",

This was a breakthrough ballet, not only because it was Stravinsky’ first popular ballet, but because it was the first ballet in which Stravinsky collaborated with Sergei Diaghilev, Bakst, and the Ballet Russes. This collaboration would also lead to the production of Petrushka and The Rite of Spring, which were both highly admired for their costuming and set design. Beside Leon Bakst, Alexandre Benois was also a prominent designer for Stravinsky’s ballet’s producing many designs for the Ballet Russes productions.",

    "description": "This painting depicts an intensely beautiful and dark scene, and typifies the artist’s talented technique. Aivazovsky was especially revered for his ability to realistically portray the shimmer of light upon water, and in this piece he does so by contrasting the moonlit waves in the foreground with the violently red water in the background, where the boats are being devoured by flames. The shimmer of the flames upon the water’s surface almost gives the painting a surreal quality by pulling the viewer into the inferno. This painting is also typical of the artist’s ability to romanticize the dramatic reality of the burning ships by contrasting them with the soft clouds, complete with full moon peeking gently from the tops.",

    "description": "The famous escapades of Suzanne Valadon (her lovers, her sensational breakups, her alcoholic son) have obscured the originality of her career. From modest origins, she worked young and carried out many activities before becoming familiar – she was then a model – with artists' studios, at a time when the space of women of her social condition was reduced to domestic interiors. His apprenticeship is made of sketches of everyday scenes, street workers, ordinary people, and his models are more often members of his entourage than professionals. The odalisque of The Blue Room takes up a pictorial cliché to reformulate it. The woman lying on the bed is not naked, but dressed, not in the oriental style like Matisse's odalisques, but like a modern woman. His shirt with suspenders, his striped pajamas not only evoke eroticism or sexual expectation but also the rest of a body in the comfort of loose and colorful clothes, which affirm a desire for modernity. The detail of the cigarette, ostensibly stuck in the mouth, then characterizes women of little virtue, like the gigolettes of Kupka or the women artists. This modernity is attached here to the representation of a mature woman, with thick hands, a weary and heavy body, with heavy breasts. According to Valadon, “you have to have the courage to look the model in the face if you want to reach the soul. Never bring me to paint a woman who is looking for the lovable or the pretty, I will disappoint her right away. The composition, which takes up the traditional scheme of the voluptuous nude framed by curtains, takes us into the bohemian intimacy of the studio saturated with intense blues. Lost in thought, the woman forgets the painter's intrusion: it's a stolen moment.\n\n[url href=https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/ressources/oeuvre/cpg8rdy]centrepompidou[/url]",

    "description": "\"This is surely one of the most gruesome pictures ever painted. Other artists, usually motivated by the higher purposes of patriotism or pacifism, have shown the disasters of war, suppression, and martyrdom; torture and pain are often represented as the just deserts of sinners tumbling into hell, and the roasting and beheading of saints are depicted to serve the greater glory of God. But Beckmann sees no purpose in the suffering he shows; there is no glory for anybody, no compensation, no gloating over justice accomplished-only enseless pain, and cruelty for its own sake. Beckmann blames human nature as such, and there seems to be no physical escape from this overwhelming self-accusation. Victims and aggressors alike are cornered. There is no exit.\r\n\r\n\"And yet, strangely, the composition is visually satisfying: it is jointed as by a master carpenter. That is the cruelest aspect of this work; it presents utter orderliness, as if to say: This is the way things are supposed to be, this is \"regularity.\" Not only the design, with its parallels and complementary angles, demonstrates this perverted \"law and order\"; the colors, too, appear well spaced and thoughtfully distributed. The woman in the right foreground may be wearing a blue corset because the tongue of the strangled man in the upper left turned blue and the painter needed a color-equilibrium. The torturer's tie may be yellow in order to correspond to the yellow wax of the candles.\r\n\r\n\"Beckmann has abandoned the Christian symbolism he used in previous works. There is no salvation in sight. One may consider the tiny window cross in the darkness outside as a symbol of hope, but otherwise the pressure in the tight little torture chamber is without relief.\r\n\r\n\"This is one moment in one attic in Germany at the end of World War I. There is no past and no future. The phonograph blares in order to blot out the cries of anguish. Its tune emphasizes the newsreel actuality of this happening: this is the present, this is the world.\r\n\r\n\"The complex psychological situations are boiled down to simple formulas. The young woman performing an involuntary split is menaced by the candle. The woman on the right, nonchalantly swept off her feet, will be unable to prevent the rape. The monkey-like sadist in the middle accomplishes his torture with scientific coolness, as if to test the degree of pain that a human being can stand. Only the dog on the left considers outside help as a possibility: he directs his howling away from the center, believing that there is somebody, something outside the confines of the frame. But he is not rational, of course!\r\n\r\n\"The foreground shows, for the first time in Beckmann's oeuvre, the pair of candles which he later used again and again in still lifes and triptychs: one has fallen and given up its ghost; the other carries bravely on. It is as if the artist wanted to leave one glimmer of hope, one little flickering light to negate the whole of darkness.\"\r\n\r\nLackner, Stephan. Max Beckmann (Master of the Art Series).

    "description": "After his trip to Italy in 1881, Renoir made changes to his painting style. Instead of painting en plein air, and with quick brush strokes, he began to carefully outline his figures, and to emphasize the contours and modeling of the scene. It has been referred to as Renoir’s “Ingres Period,” as he was highly influenced by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, the prominent neo-classical painter. The woman in the painting is Renoir’s girlfriend, Aline Charigot, who became his wife seven years after this painting was completed. It now resides, as it has since 1929, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City ",

    "description": "Kollwitz responded to Gerhart Hauptmann's play on the 1844 German weavers' revolt with her own series, The Weavers' Rebellion, which showcases her admiration for the working class. Martha Kearns, her biographer, points out that Kollwitz's series is remarkable for its portrayal of the working class taking action and suffering the consequences of their rebellion, with women playing active roles in the conflict. Significantly, Kollwitz's series begins with Misery, a print of a child's death from poverty, highlighting that her response to the weavers' revolt is rooted in the deprivations of poverty.\n\nThe Misery print is a somber depiction of hopelessness and grief. The focus of the print is the child's deathbed, where his sorrowful mother kneels beside him with her head in her hands. The child is tiny, almost skeletal, and surrounded by a heavenly bright light that contrasts with the room's gloom. This contrast highlights the child's innocence as a victim of poverty, a consequence of the oppressive working conditions that prevented survival. The room is dark, with only the light from the child illuminating it. A large loom dominates the scene, and the father, holding a sibling, looks down with downcast eyes, while the sibling gazes directly at the loom, symbolizing the source of the family's misery.\n\nKollwitz struggled with her lack of extensive etching training when she started the series. She initially used lithography to make the first three prints before switching to etchings, which she perfected with a combination of drypoint, acquatint, tusche wash, and soft ground processes. The series was unusual for combining different mediums. Kollwitz's work was displayed at the Great Berlin Art Exhibition in 1898, where it would have won the gold medal prize if Emperor Wilhelm II had not dismissed it as \"gutter art.\" Nonetheless, Kollwitz went on to win the gold medal for the series the following year.",

    "description": "Although Manet often painted himself into his scenes, this self-portrait is one of only two of just the artist himself. The painting, which was painted in the style of Diego Velazquez self-portrait in Las Meninas, portrays the artist in a brown coat and cap, paint brush and palette in hand. Although the painting shows the brush in the left hand, we can assume that it was mirror image, as Manet was right handed. X-ray analysis of this work has shown that Manet painted over a portrait of his wife, Suzanne Leenhoff (Manet), in profile. This is the only self-portrait in which Manet depicted himself as an artist, as he has included himself in many of his other paintings, albeit as a figure in the scene, as in Music in the Tuileries and The Ball of the Opera.

Although many of his paintings depicted a strong version of reality, this painting soars in imagination, the Virgin clothed in light, a halo shining from the top of her head. The many angels, who drift around her in a playful manner, look upon her as if she is a precious relic to be revered and protected. Some of the others reach out to touch her in a playful manner, as if she is already their mother. ",

When Corot presented this painting at the Paris Saloon in n1835, it created a sensation, as the crowd was in awe of the way Corot portrayed the serene harmony of the setting against the harsh reality of the dying child. Inspired by its success, Corot followed this painting with others depicting mythological creatures and legendary scenes, but they did not fare as well. ",

    "description": "Giotto was commissioned by the Ognissanti, or All-Saints, Church in Florence to create this screen painting, and it the only panel painting that has been universally accepted as his. As an altarpiece, the painting itself is vary large, over 10 feet tall. Scholars argue as to whether the piece would have been used as a choir screen, where it would have been more visible to the audience, or if it was used as the main altar of the church, in which case it would have been more visible to the brothers of the order. The piece is also indicative of Giotto’s unique technique of creating realistic three-dimensional faces and the draping of cloth upon the figures in the painting. ",

    "description": "This colorful figure painting is one of a series of Roman mythological works commissioned by Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, for his palace at Ferrara. It was part of a group of three painted by Titian between 1518 and 1525. The other two are [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/the-worship-of-venus-1518][i]Worship of Venus[/i][/url] (1518-1519) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/bacchus-and-ariadne-1523][i]Bacchus and Ariadne[/i][/url] (1520-1523). It stemmed from the Roman writer Philostratus, who left a collection of descriptions of pictures under the title \"Imagines.\" One concerned the visit of Bacchus and his entourage of satyrs and bacchantes to the island of Andros. There, the natives were blessed by the presence of a river of wine. Upon the suggestion of his patron, Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, who wanted works to decorate his private [i]studiolo[/i], Titian reconstructed the classical narrative in this masterpiece.\n\nThe scene is set on the island of Andros, where the followers of Bacchus await his arrival in varying stages of inebriation, as they drink from the island's river of wine. Bacchus himself is not present, but his ship can be seen in the distance. Meantime, gods, men, and children celebrate the sublime effects of wine, whose consumption, according to Philostratus, makes men dominant, rich, generous to their friends, handsome and tall beyond their dreams. If Philostratus' description was sparse, this painting is riotously full of detail and incident, and only Titian could create, at the center of the scene, the brilliant and unforgettable emblem of this Bacchic setting. Silhouetted against the sky, a dancing youth holds a glass wine jug. He looks up, like an astronomer, at this sun and moon of his inebriated universe. A debate about balance and the horizontal is conducted by the clear vessel, tilted, and the equator of wine that it contains. Beneath such a heavenly body, the earth will be drunk and inspiring too.\n\nWith the coming of dawn on Andros, the river god, instead of adopting his canonical reclining position, remains a lie-a-bed in his mulch of vines (top-right). The wine-red stream has also left the nymph in the foreground - based on a classical statue of Ariadne - to her erotic slumbers, as undisturbed by the singing, dancing, and drinking that continue among the elaborately interwoven throng as by Apollo's call. Titian also deviated from the original text by creating two immigrants to Andros. They are the two courtly young women reclining in the center foreground amid a litter of overturned vessels of various sorts, indicating abandon. The girl in red has had her attentions to the nude youth (deriving from a figure in Michelangelo's [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo/sketch-of-a-nude-man-study-for-the-battle-of-cascina][i]Battle of Cascina[/i][/url]) interrupted by her companion. In contrast, he has been distracted by the dancer in ochre. Now, in close conversation, the girls do not engage directly with those about them as, with lingering gestures, they lay aside the shepherds' pipes, which, in more than one sense, they have been playing. Their tune, on the paper, is now taken up by the singers standing among the trees behind them. These music-makers are to be distinguished from the Andrians - fellow mortals - and from the spirits and deities that occupy the place. It may be understood that the immortals, and indeed the Andrians themselves, have been conjured up in the imagination by the girls, or else that - sensitive to the spirit of the scene and the effects of wine - they are rewarded by the attentions of beings who await the call of mortals' music and imagination.\n\nOther figures also allude to classical statuary. The maenad (female follower of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine) dressed in white, is a reference to the sculpture of an antique torso in the Grimani collection, while the male nude pouring wine on the left appears to be a reworking of The Wounded Gaul, a work of Hellenistic art unearthed in Rome around 1515 and probably known to Titian through a drawing.\n\nTitian called this type of picture a [i]poesie[/i]. It is the creation of the artist, and it addresses its audience as does a poem, allusively - inviting a meditation, a reverie, an engagement of sensibility, and never arriving at a definitive meaning.",

Most of his patrons, rich noblemen or members of Louis XV’s court, had either been exiled or guillotined. At this time, Fragonard began a series of paintings which explored the allegories of love in less frivolous ways, and this is one such painting. According to legend, the fountain of love had the ability to set hearts alight with love, and this painting, Fragonard beautifully illustrates a young couple eager to drink from the fountain, in which two cupids offer the pair a cup to drink.

    "description": "Similar to his fellow Nabis artists, Bonnard preferred the use of color and decorative elements to the academic technicalities in art. He became devoted to flattening out his representations into two dimensions, and exploring the many properties of color. After he settled in Le Cannet, in Southern France, he became entranced with the seductive properties of the light there, and painted over 300 hundred works which portrayed the vibrant energy of the Southern French region. View from the Artist’s Studio was created only two years before his death, and with the nondescript pathway and colorful background displays more of an abstraction of form that his earlier works.",

    "description": "At the time Bonnard was painting this summer breakfast scene, Rockefeller Center stood half built and Europe was gearing itself for war. Yet the modern world seems all but ignored in Bonnard's painting, which harks back to the artistic tenets of the late 19th century, its vibrant colors conjuring up the canvases and theories of Paul Gauguin's circle. Around 1890, Bonnard belonged to the Nabis (from the Hebrew word for \"prophet\"), a group that tended to paint mystical or occult scenes in order to invoke extraordinary psychic states. As this painting shows, Bonnard still lent a hallucinatory aura to the everyday some 40 years later.\r\n\r\nBonnard resolutely painted subjects such as those in Dining Room on the Garden (Grande salle à manger sur le jardin, 1934–35) for most of his life, being called très japonard (very Japanese-like) for his attempts to create a charged psychological moment in a virtually non-perspectival domestic space reminiscent of Japanese prints. This painting, one of more than 60 dining-room scenes he made between 1927 and 1947, is neither decorative (as these works have often been called) nor is its subject truly his first concern. Dining Room on the Garden sets out to capture the moment and the intrinsically ungraspable play of mood and light. On close inspection, the colored areas within the flattened picture plane lose their relation to the objects depicted: a chair melds into the window frame; the window echoes the painting's borders, becoming a view within a view; and Marthe, the painter's oft-depicted wife, merges passively into her surroundings. It is in his ability to create a timeless microcosm while laying bare the gesture of applying paint to canvas that Bonnard's modernism is revealed.",

    "description": "This painting depicts a hay harvesting scene in the countryside near Éragny, where the artist lived with his family from 1884 until his death in 1903. In the center of the canvas, a woman uses a hayfork while behind her others do similar work in a brightly lit field punctuated by haystacks.\n\nPissarro adopted the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/pointillism]Pointillist[/url] technique in 1886, saying that \"[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/neo-impressionism]Neo-Impressionism[/url] was the next phase in the logical march of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism]Impressionism[/url].\" What set his work apart from the other Neo-Impressionists was his emphasis on rural life and labor. Pissarro's depiction of peasant life along with his own scientific explorations of color speaks to the anarchist theories he adopted in the latter half of the 1870s.\n\nPissarro felt that his scientific studies freed him from the Academy's strictures of how to see and depict reality. He also evoked the utopian visions of peasant societies he read about in the writings of anarchists Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Peter Kropotkin. Pissarro wanted \"to educate the public,\" by portraying the common man, but he also wanted to avoid idealizing and sentimentalizing his subjects. In this work, he depicts the effort of hay harvesting, both in the man at the left arching his back to toss the hay up and in the woman at the center, the strength palpable in her back and shoulders.",

    "description": "Like many artists of his day, Corot traveled to Italy to study the works of the great Renaissance masters and paint the great Roman ruins. During his youthful sojourn in the country, he was challenged by the bright sunlight of the Italian countryside, which produced intense yellow hues that threatened to wash away all other colors. He was able to overcome his challenge, however, to the benefit of his color palette, which he would take with him throughout the rest of his paintings. He learned to take a monochromatic scheme and vary the shades to beautiful complimentary tones. This particular view was also painted by Corot’s fellow artists Achille-Etna Michallon, who had been Corot’s teacher, and his friend Ernst Fries. ",

Not only was he adept at painting melodramatic and layered landscapes and coastal scenes, full of emotion and vigor, but he was also skilled at painting naturalistic portraits. This portrait is of Count Mikhail Tarielovich Loris-Melikov, a Russian-Armenian statesman and general. It illustrates the esteem at which the highly-decorated Count was held, suggesting his honor and respect. It is also highly detailed, from the grey hairs the in the subject beard, to the shimmer of his medals. This portrait also illustrates the painter’s extreme skill in depicting light in his paintings, making you wonder whether or not the gleam in Loris-Melikov’s eye is the work of the painter or the portrayal of a more deeply felt emotion.",

At the time of his death, Daumier had completed 49 drawings and 29 paintings of Don Quixote, which was one of the most famous piece of literature from the Spanish Golden Age, and a founding work of Modern Western Literature. The themes of Don Quixote, those of inventiveness, quick thinking, and deception, permeated society, and have been used by many other artists and musicians, including Picasso and Strauss, including Daumier. Perhaps in Don Quixote Daumier was able to find himself in a literary hero, as he saw himself in a quixotic struggle with the society which he so loved to satirize. ",

Other interpretations include that the philosophers are standing outside Plato’s cave, or that they are the Three Magi, outside the tomb of Jesus.  One of Giorgione’s last works before his death, it is said to have been finished by Sebastiano del Pombo, a Venetian artist who was highly influenced by Giorgione’s style.  ",

Especially noteworthy is the solid figure of Io, enrapt in sensual pleasure, set against the smoky shape of Jupiter.

    "description": "[i]The Artist and His Mother[/i] (1926-1936) represents the pinnacle of Arshile Gorky’s figurative paintings. It is based on a photograph of the painter and his mother, taken in 1912 in his native country Armenia. Only three years later, the Ottoman Empire began the systematic extermination of the Armenian people, known as the Armenian Genocide. Even though Gorky and his family survived a death march, the ordeal caused permanent damage. His mother’s health particularly suffered, and in 1919, she died of malnourishment.\n\nGorky began working on the double portrait in 1926 and worked toward the final version over the next decade. During this period, Gorky made many [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/the-artists-s-mother]preparatory sketches[/url] and studies. For example, two quick pen sketches drawn side by side were used to set up the composition and arrangement of the painting. In another pencil sketch, the artist created a detailed study for the painting by using a grid with numbered squares to enlarge the drawing. He also created another version of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/the-artist-and-his-mother-1942][i]The Artist and His Mother[/i][/url] (ca.1926-1942) in a warmer color palette. Still, this version does not appear to be as sharp and precise in its painterly treatment and finishing touches.\n\nIn [i]The Artist and His Mother[/i], Gorky applied and scrapped thin layers to give the surface the soft glow of marble or porcelain. He painted stiff figures in cool and muted colors, blending patches of ochre, blue, green, and brown. The figure of the mother resembles a statue, due to the severe posture and the flat surface of the apron that looks like a smooth piece of marble or stone. In terms of style, [i]The Artist and His Mother[/i] was influenced by the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url], especially the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-gertrude-stein-1906][i]Portrait of Gertrude Stein[/i][/url] (1906). In this painting and other portraits, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/portrait-of-vartoosh-1937][i]Portrait of Vartoosh[/i][/url] (1936-1937), the artist paid particular attention to the eyes. For Gorky, expressive eyes were characteristic Armenian features. As a child, he might have seen in his native village medieval religious paintings and manuscripts that highlighted these features. Later, while visiting American museums, Gorky discovered Russian icons, and the large eyes in Sumerian and Hittite art, which he associated with his ancestry in the Caucuses.\n\nThe horrible events that shaped Gorky’s early life and the traumatic loss of his mother come across in [i]The Artist and His Mother[/i]. When painting the scene, Gorky chose to leave parts unfinished. By erasing the two hands of his mother, he injected a sense of violence into the painting. The figures in Gorky’s art, especially his mother, seem to disintegrate in the same way that memories become more elusive with time. Gorky transformed the old photograph into introspection on his mind: on the canvas, he reconstructed the complex emotional response to the photograph. The statue-like figure of the mother, the hollow eyes, and the numb expression make her seem almost ghost-like. In comparison, the figure of the young boy has three dimensions and a distinctly sad expression. For Gorky, the painting was an expression of personal loss, and for many others, it became a symbol of the tragedy of the Armenian Genocide.",

    "description": "Bonnard, like many artists of the late 19th century, was influenced by the art of Japanese wood block prints. These prints were an object of awe for the artist, who was intrigued by the disposal of a representative third dimension of space, and the representation of the forms in two dimensions. Instead of complex light and shading, he flattened out his figures out in decorative patterns and idealized shapes. Young Girl Sitting with a Rabbit also exemplifies some of the traits that characterize Bonnard’s Nabis Period, such as the S-curve of the young girl’s body, the flourishly decorative forms, and as previously mentioned, the flat two dimensional composition.",

The speed and fluidity of movement - what Boccioni called \"a synthetic continuity\" - is brilliantly captured in this bronze piece, with the human figure gliding through space, almost as if man himself is becoming machine, moving head-on into forceful winds. Possibly in homage to Auguste Rodin's Walking Man (1877-8), and the classical Greek statue Nike of Samothrace (220-190 B.C.), Boccioni left the sculpture without arms.",

    "description": "This painting is thought to be inspired by a painting of the same theme by Annibale Carracci, an Italian Baroque painter. This painting was bought at auction in 1986 for the price of 1.6 million francs. After its exhibition at the gallery, however, it was recognized as a genuine painting by Poussin, and was given back to the original seller, who raised the asking price to over 15 million euros. The Louvre and Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon were finally able to raise enough money and purchase the painting in 2007, with the final price of 17 million euros. It now resides in the Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon. ",

They were created during Poussin’s last years of life, during which he suffered hand tremors, which made the execution of the paintings slow and painful, turning Poussin into a virtual recluse. The images in the paintings reflect a philosophical interpretation of the outside world, depicting the power and might of nature. As well as the four seasons, they also revolve through the four times of day: early morning, midday, evening, and moonlight. All four paintings (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) currently reside in the Louvre Museum in Paris, where they enjoy their own room. ",

    "description": "Morning in the Village after Snowstorm is a perfect example of Russian Cubo-Futurism. Not quite cubism, it was a method of portraying object via geometric shapes. This painting was created by Malevich in his earlier career, when his paintings were still representational and he had not clearly delineated his theories of suprematism. Russian art can usually fall within two vast categories: that of a unique artistic style and technique, and that which depicts the social life of the Russian people. Although Malevich’s paintings are often in the first category, this painting does have some elements of social awareness. His depiction of Russian peasants, trudging through a snowstorm, five years before the Russian Revolution, cannot be a mere coincidence. ",

    "description": "[i]Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i] (1877) was created during a pivotal time in the artist’s career. Caillebotte was an active member of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism]Impressionist[/url] movement, even though he painted in a more realistic style than other members of the group. The quick and loose brushwork of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet]Claude Monet[/url] or [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir]Pierre-Auguste Renoir[/url] emphasized motion and the fleeting effects of light on the surface. In contrast, Caillebotte’s precise brushwork and crisp detail gave the impression of a frozen moment or a photographic snapshot. \n\n[i]Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i] is a typical Impressionist subject, modern life in an urban setting, identified as the intersection between rue de Turin and rue de Moscou. The painting presents the urban transformation of Paris, that went through sweeping renovations of the city commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III and directed by his prefect of Seine, Baron Georges Haussmann. Caillebotte witnessed these vast transformations that were complete in 1870. [i]Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i] shows the merging of the old and the new city: the couple and the male in the foreground walk on a narrow sidewalk that represents the old city, while a newly constructed building in the backdrop marks the emergence of the new city. The painting is populated by multiple characters placed in a zigzag pattern, which represent the range of social classes that form the urban landscape. Caillebotte most prominently featured the bourgeois class, represented by the elegant couple in the foreground. Different classes are represented to a lesser extent and can be identified by their attire and activity. For instance, a man in the background carrying a ladder is likely a worker. Similarly, the two figures passing each other in front of the second building on the left are wearing unfashionable tattered clothing that indicates their lower status.\n\nCaillebotte exhibited the painting at the third Impressionist exhibition in 1877 together with another large street scene [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/le-pont-de-l-europe-1877][i]Le Pont de l’Europe[/i][/url] (1876). [i]Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i] was bought by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1964, where experts have extensively studied the painting and its many [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/rue-de-paris-jour-de-pluie-etude-1877]preparatory sketches and studies[/url] to better understand Caillebotte’s artistic process. Research and experiments conducted by the Institute have presented compelling evidence that Caillebotte used the optical device [i]camera lucida[/i] for the preparatory sketches of the painting. The device would allow the artist to see the scene and the drawing surface at the same time, making it easier to determine an accurate perspective. Still, there is no documentation supporting the claim that Caillebotte ever used such a tool. Caillebotte, possibly, never discussed his methods because many proponents of Impressionism, including writer Émile Zola, criticized paintings that emulated the crispness and precision of a photograph as ‘anti-artistic’.\n\nAfter the initial sketches which helped establish the essential spatial and architectural elements of the intersection, Caillebotte made character studies and even created a painted [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-caillebotte/rue-de-paris-jour-de-pluie-etude-1877-0][i]Sketch for Paris Street; Rainy Day[/i][/url] (1877). In the sketch, he further developed the color palette and the placement of various figures. Caillebotte continued to make changes on the original canvas, like adding new characters, the two women walking away in the background. The ambitious painting represents the height of Caillebotte’s artistic achievement, as the artist would never again attempt a multi-figure composition on this scale.",

    "description": "On a hillside near the Bibémus quarry stood an old country house known as the Château Noir (whose name—the “black manor”—may relate to a previous exterior color). Cézanne began to paint in the area around 1900, finding numerous motifs in the dense woods on the grounds of the estate, for example: Trees and Rocks in the Park of the Château Noir, c. 1904. The house, in its decrepit isolation, inspired some of the artist’s most foreboding images. The eerie structure seen in Château Noir, 1900–1904, seemingly in ruins, is half-hidden behind pines that, like the rocks of Bibémus, almost obstruct the sky. Cézanne’s saturated palette—dark greens, blues and ochers—makes the scene all the more powerful. The somber, enclosed spaces of the paintings of the Château Noir and the Bibémus quarry count among his most emotionally profound pictures and are indicative of a decided melancholy that pervades Cézanne’s work in his last decade. By this time, suffering from diabetes, the artist had become obsessed with the reality of his own mortality.",

    "description": "Bonnard was a talented artist with a gift for portraying color and light in his paintings. His floating, color-filled objects were a typical element in his paintings. In 1926, Bonnard moved to Le Cannet, off the coast of Cote de Azure in Southern France, a few miles north of the resort destination of Cannes. He was entranced by the light in the South of France, and created over 300 paintings during his stay along the Mediterranean coast. The painting depicts an incoming storm, with gray billowing clouds quickly moving toward the boats along the shore, their wooden masts creating the bleak silhouette of a forest of mast poles. ",

    "description": "Leda and the Swan, one of Twombly's most accomplished works, illustrates his career-long attraction to the stories, literature and events of classical antiquity, an interest that expanded further after moving to Rome in 1957. The title, which Twombly scrawled in the lower right corner, refers to the Roman myth in which Jupiter, transformed into a swan, seduces Leda, who would later give birth to Helen of Troy. Rather than the conventional imagery of a graceful nude languidly entangled with a swan, Twombly merged diverse media, resulting in violent and forceful swirls, scratches and zig-zags flying out in all directions. Amidst the colliding, graffiti-like elements, he included recognizable hearts, a phallus, and a window-like rectangle, the latter read as a more stabilizing aspect of this otherwise explosive painting.",

Together, their work revolutionized the stage design industry, creating movable works of art as costumes, and painting masterpiece canvases as backdrops. In the late 1890’s Bakst was a leading member of the Mir Iskusstva, or World of Art Group, of which Benois was also a prominent member. Preferring to use the light and airy feeling of gouache painting rather than full-scale works, Bakst and other members of the group often designed small interiors and books, as a way to bring art to every corner of the house.

His first work, presented in 1939, was rejected entirely, and it was not until he presented the Salon with Oedipus Taken Down from the Tree that he received critical success. This was also presented along with The Winnower, which was eventually bought by the French government. This painting is one of the few in which Millet did not portray rural French peasants, which were his most oft-painted subjects. Rather, it depicts the mythological character of Oedipus, who had been strung up on a tree by his father, is being rescued by shepherds. ",

The artist included a self-portrait in the figure of the sleeping soldier who is dressed in brown. During World War II, the city of San Sepolcro was supposed to be bombed, which would have destroyed the painting. But, the pilot of the bomber plane, Captain Clarke, who had read Aldous Huxley’s reports that The Resurrection was the greatest painting in the world, remembered that the painting was held in San Sepolcro. He ordered his men to stop the bombing, this saving the painting and the town from annihilation. After the fighting was over, it was determined that the Nazi soldiers had already left the area, and so the bombing wasn’t necessary. Captain Clarke was regarded as a hero, and the city of San Sepolcro named a street after him as a symbol of their gratitude. ",

    "description": "After it was stolen in 1972, this painting is now safely housed in the Cathedral of Castelfranco Veneto, Giorgione’s hometown. It was commissioned by the military leader Tuzio Costanzo, in memory of his son, who died while serving the Republic of Venice. The Costanzo coats of arms decorates the altar, and it has been conjectured that Nicasius, on the left of the painting, is actually a portrait of Matteo, whose tomb now lies directly below the painting in the Cathedral. The painting has suffered bad restorations, but was safely and accurately restored in 2002-2003 in Venice, before being returned to its home in Castelfranco. ",

The painting is a wonderful example of tenebrism, the portrayal of light and shadow, at which Murillo excelled. Clear sunlight shines through an opening, casting light on the boy, whose clothes are torn and feet are bare. A ceramic jug and a basket of apples lie at his side. You can almost feel the boys sorrow at his situation, as he grasps his clothes, hoping for a meal, or a bed, or whatever some nice passerby might offer him. ",

    "description": "The Thunderstorm poignantly illustrates how Grandma Moses managed to combine intensely evocative renditions of natural phenomena with dramatic anecdotal detail.\r\n\r\nThere are several levels of action in The Thunderstorm. Fierce storm clouds arc rapidly approaching over the mountains, and in the distance the trees have already begun to whip wildly in the wind. The artist's deployment of color to represent these events is extraordinarily acute: The parched yellows of a late summer meadow, the varied greens of the trees, and the shifting colors of the sky before the advancing torrent are all keenly observed.\r\n\r\nIn the foreground, Moses presents the human reaction to the oncoming threat. There is a mad rush to get the hay into the barn and, at middle distance, a black horse bolts in terror.\r\n\r\nThe girl in the yellow dress is frozen in mid-run, while strangely, behind her to the left, two other children seem oblivious to the commotion. The abstract forms used to render all the human and animal activity stand in sharp contrast to the impressionistic interplay of colors in the landscape elements of the composition. This juxtaposition of abstraction and realism was one of the principal cornerstones of the \"Grandma Moses style.\"",

    "description": "Also known as Portrait of the Artist's Mother, this painting depicts Anna McNeill Whistler, dressed in a black gown and a white lace cap, seated in profile and holding a white handkerchief in her lap. In the background, a reproduction of Whistler's View of the Thames is visible on the wall. The Japanese-inspired floral pattern on the curtain hanging at left reflects the artist's interest in the Japanese aesthetic, with his signature butterfly symbol visible in the upper right corner.\n\nAlthough the arrangement of forms may seem simple, there is a deliberate balance of shapes at play, with the rectangular shapes of the picture on the wall, the curtain, and the floor stabilizing the sitter's form. Anna McNeill Whistler, a deeply religious woman, posed for her son after a model cancelled, but due to her age, she was seated instead of standing.\n\nWhen the painting was purchased by the French government in 1891, it became the first American work to receive this honor. This elevated Whistler's reputation and helped him secure wealthy American patrons. The painting has become iconic and is widely interpreted as a symbol of motherhood, mourning (due to the colors used), or American Puritan stoicism (because of the sitter's clothes). It has inspired other artists, including Albert Herter and Henry Ossawa Tanner, and has appeared in popular culture through movies, cartoons, and advertisements.",

    "description": "Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket (1875) is the final piece in Whistler's series of nocturnes, and one of only six to depict London's Cremorne Gardens. In this painting, Whistler portrays a fireworks display in the night sky, conveying a sense of excitement and celebration. Rather than offering a clear image, the artist's sweeping brushstrokes of dark blues and greens, interrupted by small bursts of bright color, capture the effects of fireworks over the river, exemplifying the Aesthetic principle of \"art for art's sake.\" Whistler described the painting as conveying a \"dreamy, pensive mood\" rather than a narrative.\n\nDespite its significance as an early example of abstraction, The Falling Rocket was not initially well received. Critics questioned the value of the seemingly convoluted subject matter and criticized what they perceived as Whistler's reckless and careless painting technique. The negative review by John Ruskin prompted Whistler to sue for libel, submitting this painting, along with other nocturnes, as evidence. Ruskin's condemnation of Whistler's work as representative of \"the modern school\" proved accurate, as Whistler's technique of flicking paint at the canvas to create the fireworks influenced later modern artists, most notably Jackson Pollock.",

    "description": "Nativity, also known as The Holy Night or the Adoration of the Shepherds, was commissioned by Alberto Pratoneri for his family chapel in the church of St. Prosper of Reggio Emilia, in 1522. Correggio did not finish the work until the end of the decade, and it was placed in the church in 1530. The painting pivots around the baby, cradled in Mary’s arms, who emits a soft yellow glow, illuminating the dark night. A group of several angels hide in the clouds above, witnessing the scene. The painting was moved to Modena, Italy in 1640, and it is now housed in the Old Master’s Picture Gallery in Dresden, Germany. ",

    "description": "Millet considered this painting to be his masterpiece. This painting marked many milestones for the artist. He worked on this painting longer than any other painting. He also conceived the painting to rival the great works of Michelangelo and Poussin. This painting marked his departure of simple portrayals of peasant life to paintings that were more socially oriented. It was also the only painting that the artist dated. And last but not least, this was the only painting for which Millet ever won an award, in this case being the second place medal at the 1853 Paris Salon.",

A light from the left of the figures shines down upon them, bathing the girl in sunlight, and her companion in soft shadows.

    "description": "This painting was one of the few in which Fragonard tackled the history painting. Its successful completion allowed Fragonard entrance into the Academy as a “history painter,” although he soon abandoned this style and began painting his frivolous hedonistic paintings for the wealthy. This painting was bought by the King, and reproduced at the Gobelins factory, a tapestry factory in Paris, France. Although it does not have Fragonard’s typical playful elements, such as blushing cheek and simple caresses, as it is a serious work, it does have an underlying current of love and eroticism, which continued to be a theme running throughout his paintings.

    "description": "The picture may recall a particularly bad storm in January 1842 though it has not been possible to tie down the exact incident. Despite Turner's title, no ship called Ariel is known to have been lost or involved in a storm in the years immediately preceding 1842, nor is any ship of that name known to have operated out of Harwich at this time. However, Charles Ninnis has suggested that Turner misremembered the name of the Fairy, which did set out from Harwich on 12 November 1840 and sank with all hands in a storm which began the following day and was still raging on 21 November, ‘the day on which the Princess Royal was born’, as the label on the back of No. 480 has it. Turner is not known to have been at Harwich at the time but could well have witnessed the storm at Margate where he often stayed with Mrs Booth.\r\n\r\nIn addition Adele Holcomb has cast doubts on the veracity of the story that Turner had himself tied to the mast for four hours during the storm; it does indeed bear a suspicious resemblance to accounts of the marine painter Joseph Vernet. However, in the fifth edition of his notes on the Turners on view at Marlborough House, Ruskin added a report of a conversation between the Rev. William Kingsley and Turner in which the artist stressed the truth of the incident and his interest in recording the experience: ‘I had taken my mother and a cousin to see Turner's pictures, and, as my mother knows nothing about art, I was taking her down the gallery to look at the large “Richmond Park”, but as we were passing the “Snowstorm” she stopped before it, and I could hardly get her to look at any other picture; she told me a great deal more about it than I had any notion of, though I have seen many sea storms. She had been in such a scene on the coast of Holland during the war. When, some time afterwards, I thanked Turner for his permission for her to see his pictures, I told him that he would not guess what had caught my mother's fancy, and then named the picture; and he then said, “I did not paint it to be understood, but I wished to show what such a scene was like; I got the sailors to lash me to the mast to observe it; I was lashed for four hours, and I did not expect to escape, but I felt bound to record it if I did. But no one had any business to like the picture.” “But,” said I, “my mother once went through just such a scene, and it brought it all back to her.” “Is your mother a painter?” “No.” “Then she ought to have been thinking of something else.” These were nearly his words; I observed at the time he used “record” and “painting” as the title “author” had struck me before’—see Turner's sub-title in the R.A. catalogue; Ruskin himself wrote ‘Note the significant use of this word, instead of “artist”’.\r\n\r\nHowever, Ruskin records Turner's hurt reaction to the criticism (untraced) that the picture was nothing but a mass of ‘soapsuds and whitewash’: ‘Turner was passing the evening at my father's house on the day this criticism came out: and after dinner, sitting in his arm-chair by the fire, I heard him muttering to himself at intervals, “soapsuds and whitewash! What would they have? I wonder what they think the sea's like? I wish they'd been in it.”’ (Incidentally Frith, giving evidence at the Whistler versus Ruskin trial in 1878, attributed this criticism to Ruskin himself! See Ruskin, 1903–12, xxix, p. 584.) The Athenaeum's review on 14 May was typical of this abuse: ‘This gentleman has, on former occasions, chosen to paint with cream, or chocolate, yolk of egg, or currant jelly, —here he uses his whole array of kitchen stuff. Where the steam-boat is—where the harbour begins, or where it ends—which are the signals, and which the author in the Ariel...are matters past our finding out.’ Or, as the Art Union for 1 June observed, ‘Through the driving snow there are just perceptible portions of a steam-boat labouring on a rolling sea; but before any further account of the vessel can be given, it will be necessary to wait until the storm is cleared off a little. The sooner the better.’\r\n\r\nIn Modern Painters Ruskin described the Snowstorm, with two watercolours, as ‘nothing more than passages of the most hopeless, desolate, uncontrasted greys, and yet ... three of the very finest pieces of colour that have come from his hand’. Later, in a description of the effect of sea after prolonged storm he pointed out that ‘There is indeed no distinction left between air and sea; that no object, nor horizon, nor any land-mark or natural evidence of position is left ... Suppose the effect of the first sunbeam sent from above to show this annihilation to itself, and you have the sea picture of the Academy, 1842, the Snowstorm, one of the very grandest statements of sea-motion, mist, and light, that has ever been put on canvas, even by Turner. Of course it was not understood; his finest works never are...’ (Martin Butlin and Evelyn Joll, The Paintings of J.M.W. Turner, revised ed., New Haven and London 1984)",

    "description": "Beckmann served in the medical services in eastern Prussia, then in Flanders and at Strasbourg. He was a witness to the first mustard gas attacks around Ypres. At Courtrai, he was present at operations that surgeons attempted on the wounded and made detailed drawings of them. His self portrait is built around three elements: the eye that scrutinises, the hand that draws, and the red cross. There is hardly any colour. A few months later, Beckmann was sent home to Germany after suffering a serious mental breakdown. He sought refuge in Frankfurt where he slowly took up painting again.\r\n\r\n\"On my left the shooting had the sharp explosion of the infantry artillery, on my right could be heard the sporadic cannon shots thundering from the front, and up above the sky was clear and the sun bright.\" (Max Beckmann)",

    "description": "Two women, apparently drawn from the same model, are posed in a bucolic landscape by a trough, while its water is stirred by a winged Eros. The painting is rich in symbolism and iconography, although there is a lack of consensus amongst critics about its meaning. Even the title of the painting may not be original, as it was not recorded until 1693. The composition of the picture contains elements found in the work of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione]Giorgione[/url], whose style had a significant influence on Titian at the beginning of his career.\n\nThe woman to the left is dressed in wedding attire and may represent carnal love and beauty. In contrast, the nude is usually read as spiritual love, a symbol of simplicity and purity. The position of Eros, at the center of the two, therefore, may indicate the point of mediation between spiritual and sexual desires.\n\nThe coat of arms on the trough belongs to the family of Niccolò Aurelio, who later became Grand Chancellor of Venice. In May of 1514, he married Laura Bagarotto, daughter of the jurist Bertuccio Bagarotto who had been executed some months before the wedding on charges of betraying the Serenissima Republic. The painting was probably commissioned to celebrate the marriage. It has been suggested that the relief design on the front of the trough symbolizes life and death, inviting the newlywed Laura, to overcome the sorrow for the loss of her father and flourish in marital love, both spiritual and physical. Alternative readings for this design include symbolism for the taming of passions or hidden literary references.",

    "description": "Although she exhibited at the Impressionist Salon, Cassatt’s works encompassed many styles, and she frequently innovated new techniques for her paintings. In The Child’s Bath, we can see her influence from Japanese wood block prints. At the time she created this painting, the high vantage point, tight cropping of the forms, and bold outline were all unconventional artistic devices. Cassatt was able to avid an over-sentimental portrayal of this intimate scene by using the aforementioned techniques, diving us a glimpse into the bath without dripping with sweet sentimentality. Cassatt was also influenced to use this Japanese wood block technique by the works of Edgar Degas, who created many similar works. ",

    "description": "Kollwitz created a woodcut print in honor of Rosa Luxembourg and Karl Liebknecht, founders of the Marxist Spartacus League, who were executed for their involvement in the Spartacist uprising in 1919. As a supporter of Marxist politics, Kollwitz visited Liebknecht's home to offer condolences and made drawings of him at the request of his family. She began her image of Liebknecht as a lithograph but later completed it as her first woodcut print.\n\nThe woodcut print is a tribute to Liebknecht's ideas and actions and depicts him lying in state at his memorial, with mourners paying their respects. The composition plays with rigid horizontality and tilting arcs, with Liebknecht's body as a stiff, stone horizontal slab at the bottom center of the image. The mourners, mostly male workers of varying ages, occupy most of the composition and are arranged in a curved arc, with their heads and torsos bowed towards Liebknecht. The woman and child in the foreground symbolize future generations who benefit from Liebknecht's ideology, while the man's overemphasized hand prominently resting on Liebknecht's chest illustrates the physicality of the ideological fight.\n\nAlthough the woodcut print was meant to honor Liebknecht, some members of the German Communist Party objected to Kollwitz's work because she was not an official member of the party, despite her commitment to radical politics.",

    "description": "Suprematist Composition was completed in the same year Malevich wrote his Suprematist Manifesto, in which he expounded his artistic theory of suprematism. This painting is renowned as the masterpiece of the suprematist movement, one of the most innovative art movements of the 20th century. It is now considered the paradigm of the Russian avant-garde and an icon in all of Russian art. The painting made its debut at the 1919-1920 State Exhibition in Moscow, quickly establishing Malevich as one of the most influential artists of his era. It was sold at auction in 2008 for a record-setting $60 million, a record price for any Russian piece of art. \r\n",
