  "description": "Due to the negative reviews of Tiger in a Tropical Storm, Rousseau did not paint another jungle scene until seven years later. The Hungry Lion Throws itself on the Antelope was the second jungle scene he painted after his return to painting the flora and fauna of the jungle, which was based off of the diorama of stuffed animals in the Paris Natural History Museum. Upon its exhibition, it was derided by its critics, who were shocked at its display alongside establishment paintings and Renaissance sculptures. Works such as this continued to be ridiculed by his critics until his death in 1910, by he was lauded by his contemporary independent artists, such as Matisse, Picasso, and Toulouse-Lautrec. ",

  "description": "Not only did Arcimboldo use fruits, vegetables, plants, and animals as objects for the compilations in his paintings, he also used inanimate objects such as books and papers. The Librarian is one such painting. In this painting, Arcimboldo’s subject is obvious: a lover of books made up out of books. This is an example of the painter’s ability to be less literal. Whereas in other paintings, he shaped singular pieces of fruit or meat into the eyes, nose, or curve of the chin, in this painting, the pile of books only resembles a person, and upon closer inspection, the features become less clear. This is an example of Arcimboldo’s great talent of disguising his objects into the form of a person, or as in this case, disguising his person into the form of his objects.   ",

  "description": "When Gauguin returned to France in 1893, he spent most of his time in Paris promoting his work and writing and illustrating Noa Noa, a fictionalized account of his Tahitian experience. Day of the Gods (Mahana No Atua), one of the very few paintings Gauguin completed during this period, is closely related to his literary project. Set in a Tahitian landscape by the sea, the composition is divided into three horizontal bands. At the top, islanders perform a ritual near a towering sculpture. Like many figures in Gauguin’s Tahitian images, the monumental sculpture was derived not from local religion but from photographs of carved reliefs adorning the Buddhist temple complex at Borobudur (Java). In the middle band, three symmetrically arranged figures are placed against a field of pink earth in poses that may signify birth, life, and death. The woman in the center, formally linked to the sculpture at the top, is similar in appearance to other depictions of Tahitian females who Gauguin used to suggest the Christian figure of Eve in paradise. The lower portion of the composition evokes brilliant, contrasting hues reflected in the water. Gauguin’s Post-Impressionist style, defined by a decreasing tendency to depict real objects and the expressive use of flat, curving shapes of vibrant color, influenced many abstract painters of the early 20th century.",

  "description": "Apart from his larger commissioned works, most of what Giorgione painted was smaller paintings, designed for personal collectors to keep in their homes. This is one such piece, measuring 33 by 29 inches, commissioned by Gabriele Vendramin, a Venetian noble. It is said to be the first landscape in Western painting, and its symbolic implications are up to determination, as there have been many differing interpretations of its meaning. While some interpretations go so far as to indicate that the man and the woman represent Adam and Eve, the sucking babe Cain, and God in the form of lighting and the coming storm, others see no meaning in the work, and state that Giorgione had no particular story in mind while he was completing the work.

  "description": "One of the greatest Renaissance paintings of a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/mythological-painting#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]mythological[/url] nature, the life-size [i]Venus of Urbino[/i] remains the iconic version of the reclining female nude, and a treasure of the Venetian [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance]High Renaissance[/url]. The picture was based on the earlier work [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione/the-sleeping-venus-1510][i]The Sleeping Venus[/i][/url] (1510) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione]Giorgione[/url], a close friend of the artist, although Titian's interpretation of the goddess is much more erotic. This sensuality is heightened by the directness of the nude's gaze, her faint smile, and her awareness of the viewer, along with the depiction of her in an opulent domestic environment without the allegorical or mythological symbols traditionally associated with Venus. While Giorgione's nude is idealized and demure, Titian's is realistic and tempting. The warm, light tones of her skin are in contrast to the darker, more affluent background, and the play of light on her body and subtle use of [i]chiaroscuro[/i] gives a sculptural quality to the nude. Her curves also contrast with the regularity of architectural elements, including the tiled floor, classical column, and green hanging, which bisects the scene, highlighting the fertile center of the figure.\n\nTitian's exceptional talent, his bold depiction of female sensuality, and his status as the leading Venetian painter of the Cinquecento is why this picture is often cited as the origin of many of Western art's most controversial images - including, for instance, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/nude-maja-1800][i]The Nude Maja[/i][/url] (c.1797) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya]Goya[/url], as well as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/olympia-1863][i]Olympia[/i][/url] (1863) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]Edouard Manet[/url] - and is considered to be the original precursor to the pin-up.\n\nTitian painted this picture for the Duke of Camerino Guidobaldo della Rovere, who later became the Duke of Urbino, possibly to celebrate his marriage to Giuliana Varano. Despite her erotic air, Titian's Venus is no courtesan, and the painting is not a subtle promotion of casual infidelity. On the contrary, given that it was painted to commemorate Guidobaldo's marriage, it is almost certainly celebrating marital love and the physical intimacy between man and wife, a supposition supported by a number of details. In her right hand, for instance, the girl holds a posy of roses, which usually symbolize love; also, the sleeping dog is a common symbol of fidelity; lastly, the maids in the background are depicted rummaging in a traditional [i]cassone[/i], where wives commonly stored their [i]trousseaux[/i]. Perhaps the picture was conceived as an ideal model of behavior for Giuliana, the Duke's young bride. It was certainly not uncommon for pictures of an explicitly erotic nature to be commissioned to celebrate a wedding, although they would be intended for private viewing only.\n\n[i]The Venus of Urbino[/i] is full of artistic devices. To begin with, Titian achieves a beautiful contrast between the voluptuous curves of the girl's body and the vertical and horizontal lines of the dividing screen, floor tiles, and other architectural elements. The play of light on the girl's body and Titian's delicate [i]chiaroscuro[/i] lends a sculptural quality to her figure and also enhances the silky drapery of the bedsheets. The floor tiles provide an extra linear perspective, while the floral patterns of the couch, [i]cassoni[/i], and background tapestry - in conjunction with the rich color pigments of the screen and the maid's costume - help to unify and activate the composition.\n\nBy the time he executed this work, Titian was established as the leading master of Renaissance art in Venice. Above all, he was known for his remarkable use of color, and his works - which spanned all the major genres, including church altarpieces, mythological painting, portrait art, and pastoral landscape - were increasingly sought after by members of Italian Royal Houses. He went on to become recognized as a genius in his own time and has since been revered by such Old Masters as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck]Van Dyck[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin]Poussin[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/peter-paul-rubens]Rubens[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez]Velazquez[/url]. In many subjects and painting genres, he set patterns that were copied by generations of painters, especially in portraiture. Unfortunately, his talent as an artist was not matched by his generosity of spirit: he became notorious for his greed and miserliness.",

  "description": "The best known work by Rembrandt, this painting resides at the State Museum in Amsterdam, where it is lauded as one of the most famous paintings in the world. For much of its history, the painting was covered with a thick layer of varnish, giving the impression that it was a night scene, hence the name. The varnish was removed in 1940, revealing the bright colors of the painting. The painting has also suffered damage at the hand of art dealers, who in 1715 cut the painting down on three side on order to fit it between two columns, and vandals, who have purposely tried to ruin the painting. In 1975, an unemployed school teacher attacked the work, leaving a large section of zig-zags scratches. The painting was successfully restored, although the scratches are still somewhat visible. In 1990, the painting was attacked again, by a man who threw acid on the canvas. The acid was quickly neutralized, however, and the painting was saved. ",

  "description": "One of Goya’s earlier works, he painted this fresco on the ceiling of the Basilica in the small town of Zaragoza, Spain. He received the commission to paint the ceiling upon returning from his trip abroad to Italy as an art student. As a relatively unknown painter at the time, he received 10,000 reales less than the other, more well known artists who contributed to paintings in the Basilica, but it was to his benefit, as it afforded him an audience for his work, which was soon to be the Spanish royal family and nobility.",

The name \"Peeping Tom\" for a voyeur originates from later versions of this legend in which a man named Tom watched her ride and was struck blind or dead.",

  "description": "Renoir sold this painting to the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who supported the impressionists, after its completion. The painting, arguably one of Renoir’s most famous works, contains many of Renoir’s close friends, including his future wife, relaxing at the Maison Fournaise along the Seine River. Renoir often included his friends and acquaintances in his paintings, and this one is no different. At the bottom left of the composition, a woman holding a dog (monkey pincher), is seamstress Aline Charigot, whom later became Renoir’s wife. The painting also includes other close friends, actors, the proprietors of the establishment, and prominent social figures of his day. As such, it can be seen as a snapshot of the social times, as well as a depiction of a relaxing day on the river. ",

The young woman renounced her family and her Roman Catholic background to be with the painter, and the couple soon had one daughter. After two years together, Modigliani died of the tuberculosis from which he suffered the majority of his life. Jeanne, grief-stricken and inconsolable, threw herself out of a fifth-floor window, killing herself and their unborn child. Complete with a long, thin frame and head cocked coyly to the side, the painting is done with such care and simple beauty that you can almost see Jeanne through Modigliani’s eyes. ",

The painting is of a woman named Beatrice Hastings, who had a love affair with the artist for over two years, and sat for many of his paintings. This portrait illustrates the artist’s style of turning the face into a mask-like image, and the elongation of the form of the body, in this case an exaggeratedly long and thin neck. The subject is also perhaps a bit of a social critique, as the pompadour is also in his stylized, exaggerated form of simple lines, using a traditional image to steer away from the traditional style of painting.

  "description": "Botticelli’s fame faded after his death in 1510, as he quickly fell under the shadow of his great contemporaries Michelangelo and Raphael. This is his only signed painting. It was not until a British art collector named William Young Ottley, who bought the painting in 1799 and returned with it to England, that Botticelli’s fame began to rise. It was first exhibited in Manchester in 1857, where more than a million people viewed the painting. After the exhibition, Botticelli’s frescoes in Italy began to receive more and more attention, and artists were recreating Botticelli’s image in monographs by 1893. His popularity was still spreading, and in the first two decades of the 20th century, more works were written about Botticelli than any other artist. ",

  "description": "In April of 1890, Cassatt visited an exhibition of Japanese colored woodcuts at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Afterward, she decided to produce a sequence of ten prints that would depict the daily life of a contemporary woman. The completed series contained depictions of women getting ready, washing their children, having tea, and more. This particular piece portrays a woman sealing a letter at her desk. The composition creates balance by combining patterns (the wallpaper and the woman's dress) with solid areas of color (the vertical back of the desk and the paper of the letter and envelope). The viewer is drawn into the shallow space of the room, where the skewed writing panel of the desk illustrates the use of forced perspective. These artistic choices were influenced by traditional Japanese printmaking, but the woman's clothing and other objects are all contemporary elements of Cassatt's world.\n\nMary Cassatt often depicted the private lives of women and children in her paintings. The Letter is one such painting, which she created in the Japanese wood block print style. The graphic decorations on the woman’s dress, as well as the wallpaper behind her, indicate the extent of Japanese art on her style. The artwork, which depicts a woman sitting at a desk inside, mailing an envelope, is a more than just a quaint genre painting. By painting the woman indoors, Cassatt was making a statement about the way women were treated. In this case, the woman is sitting inside in solitude, due to the fact that social mores restricted the activities that she could do outside the home.",

  "description": "The genre of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]self-portraiture[/url] fully developed in Western painting during the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Renaissance[/url]. [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]Dürer’s self-portraits[/url] are not only among the earliest examples of the genre, but are also some of the finest works of self-portraiture ever produced in Western art.  [i]Self Portrait at the Age of Twenty Eight[/i] (1500) is particularly significant; it is an artistic proclamation that is deeply tied to how Durer wanted to position himself in the context of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/northern-renaissance#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]Northern Renaissance[/url] and the Humanist movement.\n\nThe self-portrait gave Dürer the opportunity to display the breadth of his technical skill, particularly in creating the textures of his luscious hair and rich fur. It is likely that the portrait remained in Dürer’s cabinet, exhibited in private viewings to impress prospective clients and used for demonstrations to his students. In the self-portrait, the artist adorns a fashionable brown coat with a fur trim, a garment worn by 15th century noblemen. The garment is a symbol of social status, and indicates Dürer’s climb on the social ladder. This also represents the new status of artists in the Renaissance, where they were elevated from anonymity, and recognized publicly as creators and not mere craftsmen. The self-portrait is accompanied by the inscription: [i]“I, Albrecht Durer of Nuremberg painted myself thus, with undying colors, at the age of twenty eight years”[/i]. In the Medieval era, the age twenty eight signified the transition to maturity. The inscription plays up this symbolism, signifying the artist entering a new era.\n\nThe frontal portrait is highly unusual for a secular portrait. It deliberately invites the comparison to the image of Christ, particularly to the iconography of Christ as [i]Salvator Mundi[/i] (Savior of the World). The self-portrait evokes the concept of [i]Imitatio Christi[/i], the ideal of imitating and following the Christ. It is possible that Dürer emphasized the biblical idea that Man was created in God’s image, and through the self-portrait he was asserting that his creativity originates in divine grace. However, Dürer’s use of religious iconography also expresses humanist values. The frontal portrait exemplifies symmetry and harmony, ideals praised by ancient writers such as Cicero and Vitruvius, and promoted by Italian Renaissance humanist Leon Battista Alberti. Dürer, and in particularly this self-portrait, were praised by German Renaissance humanist, Konrad Celtes. \n\nDürer and Celtes, along with other German humanists were proponents of the Northern Renaissance, and had the ambition to bring forward a cultural Golden Age. In a text addressed to Dürer, Celtes links him to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/apelles]Apelles[/url], a renowned painter of Ancient Greece. Celtes called Dürer the “second Apelles”, and indeed in the self-portrait Dürer presents himself as a Christian Apelles. The dark and minimal color scheme of the self-portrait may have been inspired by Apelles, who was celebrated for his four color system of painting and his dark, glossy glaze. Therefore, [i]Self Portrait at the Age of Twenty Eight[/i] can be understood as an artistic statement, Dürer absorbing the praise of his contemporaries and reaffirming his position as the “new Apelles” of the Northern Renaissance.",

  "description": "'Tables for Ladies' places the viewer directly outside the front window of an ordinary restaurant in New York City. The viewer's gaze is directed past the menu cards and the vividly painted foods in the window display and the waitress who leans forward to adjust them, into an interior of polished wood, tiled floors, and wall mirrors where a man and woman eat and a cashier attends to business at her register. Hopper painted this large canvas in the studio, working from sketches that he had made of local restaurants. Yet despite the bright lighting and the warm, even garish, colors, this is not a particularly festive scene. The two diners chat between themselves, but the cashier and the waitress are lost in their separate thoughts and duties. As in many of his works, Hopper indirectly comments on the loneliness and weariness that so many city dwellers experience.\r\nDespite Hopper's reluctance to assign historical context to his work, this painting also speaks of several social changes of the era. For example, it represents the new roles that women were occupying in public; both the cashier and the waitress, for example, are women working outside the home. The title also alludes to a recent social innovation, in which dining establishments advertised \"tables for ladies\" in order to welcome their newly mobile female customers. In the past, it had often been assumed that women appearing alone in restaurants or bars were prostitutes in search of business; now, dining on their own or with other women, they would be treated respectfully. In addition, the date of this painting serves as a reminder that Hopper was living in New York during the Great Depression, when many Americans could not afford to dine out, even at such an unpretentious establishment as this one.",

  "description": "Edward Hopper and his wife first rented a cottage in Truro, Massachusetts, in the summer of 1930, and they would return there regularly through the 1950s. Hopper began 'Office in a Small City' while he was staying in Truro in the summer of 1953, and he finished it in his New York studio in the fall. Rather than depicting the Cape Cod landscape, however, 'Office in a Small City' is a scene that could have taken place in any American town in the mid-twentieth century. Hopper's explanation of his earlier work 'Office at Night' (1940; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis) also applies to this painting: \"My aim was to try to give the sense of an isolated and lonely office interior rather high in the air, with the office furniture which has a very definite meaning to me.\"\r\nThe solitary office worker in this scene is isolated both physically and emotionally. There is no indication of his particular profession, as he sits in his shirtsleeves; he appears, in fact, to be daydreaming rather than working. The postwar culture of American business is evident in the mass-produced office furniture, the impersonal atmosphere of the office itself, and the man's detachment from his unseen coworkers. Despite the light and air afforded by his corner office, he appears trapped in place. He is framed by the office window, and his head is profiled against another window and the wall of the building beyond, in a manner that suggests his containment within his environment. The solitude of the man, and the contrast between the stark, utilitarian upper story of the building and its decorative false front, visible at the lower right, suggest Hopper's own ambivalence toward modern urban life.",

  "description": "Ingres created this painting upon a commission of the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, who had promised it to the citizens if the town of Liege, Belgium, as a sign of appreciation for their graciousness, despite their miserable condition after Austrian bombardment. Unable to get Napoleon to sit for the painting, Ingres had to recreate the emperor’s image based off an 1802 portrait by Jean-Antoine Gros. In the painting, Napoleon is signing a decree, the same decree that gave 300,000 francs to the town of Liege for rebuilding their city. Unlike the Gros painting, Napoleon is depicted not as the conquering hero, but as a civilian officer, doing the duty of the people.",

  "description": "The Charge of the Lancers is the only known work by Boccioni that is devoted exclusively to the theme of war. Being a collage, Charge was also a rare departure for the artist in terms of medium. In previous works, Boccioni had used the figure of the horse as a symbol for work, but in this collage the horse becomes a symbol of war and natural strength, since it appears to be overcoming a horde of German bayonets. If, in fact, Boccioni was establishing the brute strength of the horse over man-made weapons, it would suggest a slight departure from the Futurist principles of Marinetti. This work also eerily prefigures Boccioni's own death from having been trampled by a horse. ",

Set on a rocky promontory in Cape Elizabeth, Maine, the architecture is bathed in bright sunlight offset by dark shadows. Standing proudly upright and seen from below, the lighthouse at Two Lights seems to symbolize a resolute resistance, even refusal, to submit to change or nature. For Hopper, who had been summering in Maine since 1914, the lighthouse also signified a pleasurable reprieve from life in New York.",

The painting was commissioned by a rich patron Vincenzo Guistanini, who retained it in his possession and reportedly loved it above all others. The painting was an immediate success, and inspired contemporary artworks, including poems and epigrams along the same theme. ",

  "description": "The Burial of the Count of Orgas is widely considered one of El Greco’s masterpieces. The painting depicts a popular legend, regarding the Count of Orgas, who was a pious man, and who upon his death left a large sum of money to the church. The legend tells that Saint Stephen and Saint Augustine descended from heaven at his funeral and buried them with their own hands. Andres Nunes, the parish priest of Sao Tome, was the commissioner of the work, who intended it for a project to refurbish the Count’s burial chapel. According to the commission, the observers of the burial were to be portraits of the notable men of Toledo at the time. The successful inclusion of a gallery of portraits of prominent men secured its esteem, and helps to rank El Greco as a master of his time. ",

The scene depicts adorers greeting the baby Jesus, employing Giotto’s techniques such as the draping of cloth and the emotion on the faces of the figures in the scene, as well as the use of three-dimensional techniques, helping the viewers place themselves in the scene. One of the most interesting components of this fresco is the Star of Bethelehem in the form of a comet shooting through the sky. It is thought that Giotto was inspired to paint this Star in this form due to a 1301 viewing of Halley’s Comet. ",

  "description": "This painting is one of the first representations of the urban proletariat. Whereas peasants ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-francois-millet/the-gleaners-1857][i]The Gleaners[/i][/url] (1857) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-francois-millet]Millet[/url]) or country workers ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet/the-stone-breakers-1849][i]The Stone Breakers[/i][/url] (1849) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet]Courbet[/url]) had often been shown, city workers had seldom been painted. Unlike Courbet or Millet, Caillebotte does not incorporate any social, moralizing, or political message in his work. His thorough documentary study (gestures, tools, accessories) justifies his position among the most accomplished realists.\n\nCaillebotte had undergone a completely academic training, studying with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leon-bonnat]Bonnat[/url]. The perspective, accentuated by the high angle shot and the alignment of floorboards complies with tradition. The artist drew one by one all the parts of his painting, according to the academic method, before reporting them using the square method on the canvas. The nude torsos of the planers are those of heroes of Antiquity, it would be unimaginable for Parisian workers of those times. But far from closeting himself in academic exercises, Caillebotte exploited their rigor in order to explore the contemporary universe in a completely new way.\n\nCaillebotte presented his painting at the 1875 Salon. The Jury, no doubt shocked by its crude realism, rejected it (some critics talked of \"vulgar subject matter\"). The young painter then decided to join the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism]Impressionists[/url] and presented his painting at the second exhibition of the group in 1876, where [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas]Degas[/url] exhibited his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas/woman-ironing-silhouette-1873][i]Woman Ironing[/i][/url] (1873). Critics were struck by this great modern tableau, Zola, in particular, although he condemned this \"painting that is so accurate that it makes it bourgeois\".",

  "description": "The epic painting [i]The Raft of the Medusa[/i] features a gruesome mass of figures afloat at sea, some dead, some struggling for life, in a tangled mass positioned on a crudely-made raft. The only African figure on the raft waves a cloth at the top of a pile of a few men who are struggling to get the attention of a ship in the distance (located on the far right of the horizon line). The sail of the raft is billowing in the wind while being tossed about a choppy ocean beneath a stormy sky. Géricault paid great attention to the details in this work. He even [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-gericault/heads-of-torture-victims-study-for-the-raft-of-the-medusa]sketched severed body parts[/url] in order to make the image as authentic as possible.\n\nThe subject depicted is the artist's dramatic interpretation of the events beginning on July 2, 1816, when a French navy frigate crashed on its way to colonies in West Africa. The appointed governor of the colony and the top-ranking officers in the party left on the ship's six lifeboats leaving the remaining 147 passengers to be crowded onto a hastily made raft. When the raft proved too cumbersome, in a horrific act of cowardice and fear, the ship's leader cut the ropes to the raft. Left to fend for themselves for 13 days, the passengers eventually resorted to cannibalism. When rescued by a passing British ship, only 15 men were left alive, of whom 5 died before they were able to reach land. When the public learned of this, it became an international tragedy and a searing indictment of the current French government. \n\nThe decision to paint a scene from contemporary history - one that was utterly of the moment - brought instant attention to this work, particularly as Gericault translated it in a manner befitting classical history painting (large-scale, with heroic and tragic elements). The painting shocked the public and divided critics at the 1819 Salon. The shipwreck had scandalous political implications at home—the incompetent captain, who had gained the position because of connections to the Bourbon Restoration government, fought to save himself and senior officers while leaving the lower ranks to die—and so Géricault’s picture of the raft and its inhabitants was greeted with hostility by the government. Critics were divided: the horror and \"[i]terribilità[/i]\" of the subject exercised fascination, but devotees of classicism expressed their distaste for what they described as a \"pile of corpses,\" whose realism they considered a far cry from the \"ideal beauty\" incarnated by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anne-louis-girodet]Girodet[/url]'s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anne-louis-girodet/pygmalion-et-galat-e-1819][i]Pygmalion and Galatea[/i] [/url](1819) which triumphed the same year. Géricault's work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? Coupin (art critic of the Revue encyclopédique) was categorical: \"Monsieur Géricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel.\"\n\nDisappointed by the reception of [i]The Raft of the Medusa[/i], Géricault took the painting to England in 1820, where it was received as a sensational success.

In creating it, Géricault showed a complexity of composition and an almost unsettling portrayal of reality, differed from anything that had been seen before.

  "description": "This painting exemplifies the naturalism and realism for which the artist was so renowned. The detail in the foreground and the expanse of the view is almost as alluring as the clear blue sky. The painting illustrates the heart of a bustling city, complete with merchants on camelback, and ladies watching the crowd from their balconies, and sets it against the beautiful expanse of development throughout the valley below, from the hilltops and cliff faces, to the valley below. The tree leaves themselves look as if they might rustle in with a slight breeze. The play of light and shadow is also skillfully done, suggesting that the sun is growing low on the horizon.  ",

  "description": "The Women of Algiers caused a sensation when it was displayed at the Paris Salon on 1834. Not only was it mentionable at the time for its sexual connotations, but also for the portrayal of opium, which at the time was only included of paintings of prostitutes. This painting was also notable because it was generally difficult to paint Muslim women, who were covered head to toe, but Delacroix was secretly able to sketch some during his travels to Morocco in 1832. It was critically acclaimed when it was presented to the Salon, and King Louis Philippe bought the painting, presenting it to the Museum of Luxembourg. Seven years after Delacroix’s death, it was moved the Louvre, where it is displayed among Delacroix’s other masterful paintings. ",

The virgin sits in a vibrant red dress on a deep blue shawl, holding the unclothed child, who stands on her lap. The two figures hold each other in a tender embrace, as only a mother and a child can do, which is a typical element of Murillo’s paintings. This tender touch is indicative of a realistic element that is present in all of Murillo’s paintings, almost as it is a snapshot of the two figures before they were completely posed, as if in a candid photograph.

Both have lifted their chemises to reveal naked buttocks and thighs and black knee-length stockings. The blonde has a look of resignation. Her eyes are downcast and her dress gathered in front to preserve what remains of her dignity. Her younger colleague seems more assertive. With her bright red hair, rouged cheeks and chemise hoisted high, she approaches her assignation with some boldness. A third women in a turquoise kimono (probably another colleague) walks away from them towards a group of people below a large window through which can be seen a clock tower (perhaps a church or the nearby Bibliotèque Nationale).",

  "description": "Monet’s Water Lilies series contained around 250 paintings, which he painted during the last thirty years of his life at his house in Giverny, France. Many of the paintings were completed while Monet was suffering from cataracts, which gave him a redder tone to his vision, which is represented in some of his paintings. He went through two surgeries in 1923 to remove his cataracts, which many have left his eyes more sensitive to ultraviolet wavelengths, as he went back and repainted some of his water lilies with a bluer tone. Works from Monet’s Water Lilies series are now housed all over the world, and have sold at auction for almost $41 million. ",

  "description": "[i]The Liver is the Cock’s Comb[/i] (1944) is one of Arshile Gorky’s largest and most noteworthy paintings. It combined several influences that marked the emergence of Gorky’s mature original style. The artist blended elements of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/cubism]Cubism[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url], specifically from the paintings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Pablo Picasso[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro]Joan Miró[/url]. Additionally, the color range in [i]The Liver is the Cock’s Comb[/i] can be connected to the works of Russian artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/wassily-kandinsky]Wassily Kandinsky[/url], much admired by Gorky. Another prominent figure that helped in Gorky’s artistic development was Chilean surrealist painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roberto-matta]Roberto Matta[/url]. He advised Gorky to thin his paints with turpentine, which allowed the colors to run, smudge, and drip, acquiring a translucent quality. It made the colors in [i]The Liver is the Cock’s Comb[/i] more vibrant and sensuous than in earlier works, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/garden-in-sochi][i]The Garden in Sochi[/i][/url] (1943).\n\nGorky was inspired by nature, his physical surroundings, as well as by memories of his father’s garden in Armenia. The artist aimed to present complexities and contradictions of his life, and so the painting and its title hold multiple layers of meaning. The peculiar title was the result of Gorky’s collaboration with the surrealist André Breton on New Year’s Eve 1944. Breton, the author of the [i]Surrealist Manifesto[/i], praised the artwork, stating it was one of the most famous paintings produced in America. On a superficial level, some shapes resemble livers floating in space, while other crown-like forms are similar to a cock’s combs. However, some have suggested that these shapes were products of the artist’s imagination, and as such, they did not represent any particular object found in nature.\n\nFurthermore, scholars have offered other explanations that give the title a range of meanings. The liver was considered the ancient organ of love, and the phrase [i]cock’s comb[/i] can be interpreted as a sexual pun. In this case, the title could mean that love is lust, making the painting a representation of passion and desire. Therefore, the shapes can signify biological organisms or human reproductive organs freely floating in space. Another possibility is that the pun [i]cock’s comb[/i] refers to conceit or vanity. If the word [i]liver[/i] is understood as the one who lives, the title could be a statement: one who is actively alive already engaged in the greatest of vanities.\n\nThe painting was based on a drawing done the previous year, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/study-for-the-liver-is-the-cocks-comb-1943][i]Study for The Liver is the Cock’s Comb[/i][/url] (1943). It was not uncommon: before creating oil paintings, Gorky usually made several preparatory sketches and studies. In this way, he established the foundations of the painting in terms of color and composition. Still, when working with oil paint, Gorky improvised in some sections by changing color areas or adding new shapes. Overall, Gorky preserved the graphic style seen in the drawing but accentuated the contours and colors, which resulted in a fantastical and mysterious landscape.",

  "description": "In 1891, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism]Post-Impressionist[/url] artist Paul Gauguin left France to travel to the island of Tahiti. For Gauguin, the tropical island held the promise of a ‘primitive paradise’, that was free from the constraints of modern society. However, once he arrived, Gauguin realized that the place he envisioned did not exist: the island was dealing with the impacts of colonialism and modernity, and native customs and culture seemed to be headed towards extinction. In his art, he tried to reimagine this lost paradise and experience the native Polynesian culture and customs.\n\n[i]Spirit of the Dead Watching (Manaò Tupapaú)[/i] (1892) was one of the artist’s best-known works from his[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/all-works#!#filterName:Period_1st-tahiti-period,resultType:masonry] first visit to Tahiti[/url]. The painting depicts a young Tahitian girl haunted by the Tupapaú, the Polynesian spirit of the dead. The girl in the painting was Teha’amana, Gauguin’s young lover, and ‘native-wife’. In his Tahiti journals [i]Noa Noa[/i], he described the incident that inspired the painting: “One day I had to go to Papeete… I had promised to return that very evening…  It was one in the morning by the time I arrived… The lamp had gone out and when I came home the bedroom was dark. I felt a sort of fear… I struck some matches and saw [what I pictured in my painting Manaò] Tupapaú.” Frightened by the spirits, Teha’amana lies naked on her stomach rigid and tense while glancing sideways toward the viewer.\n\nIn [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] Gauguin wanted to represent the Polynesian fear of the Tupapaú, who is depicted as an older woman wearing a black cloak. On the back wall, there are several white forms, that Gauguin described as phosphorescent lights, which symbolize the spirits that haunt the living. Gauguin depicted the figure of the Tupapaú in a similar fashion in the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/words-of-the-devil-1892][i]Parau na te Varua ino (Words of the Devil)[/i][/url] (1892). In both cases, the artist juxtaposed the fearful nude figure with the Tupapaú: the Tupapaú is painted in cool tones that contrast the warm shades of the female nudes.\n\nThe painting also closely relates to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/olympia-1863][i]Olympia[/i][/url] (1863) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]Édouard Manet[/url], a painting Gauguin greatly admired and even took a photograph of it with him to Tahiti. In the same way that Manet’s [i]Olympia[/i] represented a modern incarnation of Venus, Gauguin wanted to showcase his version of a native Venus. This connection was also established by Gauguin’s European contemporaries, the French writer Alfred Jarry called her ‘a brown Olympia’. [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] was important to Gauguin, he made several versions of the motif in drawings and woodblocks and even featured it in the background of the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/self-portrait-in-a-hat][i]Self-portrait in a Hat[/i][/url] (1893).\n\nAs new discourses developed, Gauguin’s [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] prompted new readings and interpretations. Gauguin described his relationship with then thirteen-year-old Teha’amana through the contrasts of youth and old age, of light and darkness and life and death. Given the fact that Gauguin was an older man in the position of taking advantage of his subject, the story behind [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] can take on a different meaning. Did the spirits cause Teha’amana uneasiness or was she frightened by someone she sees beyond the picture plane? ",

  "description": "'Hotel Lobby' is a signature piece in Hopper's work, displaying his classic themes of alienation and brevity. The Hoppers traveled frequently, staying in many motels and hotels throughout his career. This is one of two works in his catalog that depicts a hotel, the other being 'Hotel Window' (1955). It is also one of the two paintings that he created in 1952, both of which dealt with alienated couples. The older couple are believed to represent Hopper and his wife, at that date in their 60s. The hotel guests have been described as being \"both traveling and suspended in time,\" reflecting a stoic and dramatic feeling, reminiscent of the film noir movies Hopper might have seen and the complex structure and feeling of works by Edgar Degas. The painting utilizes harsh light and rigid lines to create a \"carefully constructed\" uncomfortable environment. The elevated and theatrical vantage point of the painting may be derived from Hopper's love of Broadway theatre which he often watched from the balcony.",

His beautiful decorations led to further commissions, and in 1903-04 he was commissioned to complete the stage designs for the Marinskii theatre. By 1909, he had begun collaborating with Sergei Diaghilev, co-founding the Ballet Russes, for which he was the artistic director. By this time, was an internationally famous artist, renowned for his bright decorations and costumes. One of his most applauded designs is his set decoration for the ballet Scheherazade, in 1910, of which this is a design.  ",

  "description": "This painting depicts Napoleon in his decadent coronation costume, seated upon his golden-encrusted throne, hand resting upon smooth ivory balls. It was first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1806, and received such bad reviews that Ingres was humiliated, and vowed never to exhibit again at the Salon, and refused to return to return to Paris. Although the painting was owned at the time by the Corps Legislatif, a part of the French legislature, the painting contains certain markings at the top right of the painting, leading art historians to believe that the painting was originally commissioned as portrait of Napoleon as King of Italy.

Although Amsterdam was part of the Holy Roman Empire at the time, it also had a large Jewish population, and so this is a story of which many of Rembrant’s contemporaries would have been familiar. The artist’s intention at the time was to create a portrait of a religious story to which the public, who were largely illiterate, could refer. Rembrandt produced many stories from the bible for the same purpose, including Return of the Prodigal Son and Christ with the Sick around Him. ",

Hokusai was a master at evincing an almost religious reverence for the majesty of the mountain, which stands like a fortress in the middle of the painting, allowing the dragon of smoke to escape.  ",

  "description": "[i]Self-portrait with Halo and Snake[/i] (1889) is a unique and radical [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait]self-portrait[/url] in the artist’s body of work. His [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]interest in self-portraiture[/url] was especially pronounced in 1888 and 1889, in part because of his relationship with his fellow artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent Van Gogh[/url]. Gauguin stayed with Van Gogh in Arles for two months in 1888, and afterward, the two continued to exchange artistic ideas through correspondence.\n\nPainted on a cupboard door, [i]Self-portrait with Halo and Snake[/i] presents an image that is both angelic and demonic. The artist includes three Christian symbols in the painting – the yellow halo over his head, the apples that dangle from a branch on the left, and the snake which he holds in his right hand. Together these symbols reference the biblical story of the Temptation of Adam and Eve and the Fall of Man. By combining these symbols, Gauguin presents himself as both a saint and a sinner or a figure of a fallen angel. This duality is also evident in the composition of the painting: the top half depicts Gauguin with the halo looking away from the temptation (apples) while the bottom half shows grasping the snake. The image possibly reflects the artist’s inner struggle as well as the enigmatic way in which he wished to portray himself to others.\n\nIn the painting, there is no sense of spatial dimension, and the large areas of flat colors demonstrate the influence of Japanese prints and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/cloisonnism]Cloisonnism[/url] – a post-impressionist style characterized by bold flat forms enclosed by dark outlines. Another important influence in [i]Self-portrait with Halo and Snake[/i] is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting]ancient Egyptian art[/url] and imagery. The shape of Gauguin’s long hair is similar to the ceremonial wigs of Egyptian gods, Pharaohs, and court officials. Gauguin was familiar with these conventions through the plaster cast of the Giza [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting/khafre-enthroned--2570]sculpture of The Pharaoh Khephren[/url] at the Ethnographic Museum of Trocadéro and the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting/the-goddess-hathor-welcomes-sethos-i--1069]Relief from the Tomb of Sethos I[/url] at the Louvre. The Egyptian influence is also evident in the way Gauguin paints the hand and the snake. The snake was possibly modeled after the snake symbol featured on Pharaoh’s personal emblem on the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting/stele-of-the-serpent-king-stela-of-djet--3000]Stela of Djet[/url] at the Louvre. The grasp of the snake is not realistic, and the hand is depicted from a frontal view which is characteristic of Egyptian reliefs and wall paintings. In the foreground of the painting, Gauguin added an ornamental element of a vine-like plant or flower. The vines could have been modeled after the lotus and the papyrus plant, that were often featured on Egyptian reliefs, sculptures, and wall paintings.  \n\n[i]Self-portrait with Halo and Snake[/i] is a companion piece to [[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/portrait-of-meyer-de-haan-by-lamplight-1889]i]Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan[/i][/url] (1889). The two works were intended to be part of a decorative panel in Gauguin’s dwelling in the village Le Pouldu. The companion portrait depicts Gauguin’s close friend, the Dutch painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/meijer-de-haan]Meijer de Haan[/url] in the pose of a thinker. The redhaired painter is staring at two books, John Milton’s [i]Paradise Lost[/i] and Thomas Carlyle’s [i]Sartor Resartus[/i], contemplating issues of religion and philosophy. Some have suggested that the portraits address similar themes through different references: both present the artist in a sort of inner struggle and as figures that have a strong connection to the spiritual and mystical realm.",

  "description": "In addition to this painting of Diego Rivera, a famous muralist, Modigliani painted many portraits of his peers, including Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris, Max Jacob, and Chaim Soutine, among others influential philosophers and thinkers of his time. Strangely, this painting deviates from Modigliani’s norms of elongated features and simple forms. There is a great amount of texture on Rivera’s face, which is the most complete area of the painting, the lines and strokes fading away as you get farther from the face. Rivera seems to be amusedly sitting for the painter, who with quick brush strokes, is quickly capturing his form. ",

Eight fishermen in the foreground of the painting are struggling against the smoothly rippling waves, trying to pull fish from the water. Although night sky is black, it gives off a strange yellow glow, which allows the fishermen to see what they are doing. Hokusai’s method of creating swirling lines in the water make it seem as if it contains a quickly moving current, which threatens to pull the fishermen down, and let their newly-caught prey escape.

  "description": "The Disrobing of Christ, otherwise known as El Espolio, was commissioned for the High Altar of the sacristy of the Cathedral of Toledo, in which it still resides today. El Greco secured the commission due to his friendship with Luis, the son of the Dean of the Cathedral, Diego de Castilla, who also commissioned his other great religious work, the paintings for the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, in Toledo. El Greco worked on both paintings simultaneously. Upon delivery, the church officials did not agree with some of the elements of the painting, including the addition of the three Marys in the foreground and that fact that Christ’s executioners are above him in the composition. This led to a legal dispute over the price of the painting, for which El Greco only received 350 out of the 950 ducats he was promised. ",

  "description": "In this expansive artwork, Courbet depicts his meeting with Alfred Bruyas, a significant patron and supporter of the artist. The painting conveys the collector's admiration for Courbet's talent. The servant, as an extension of Bruyas, is captured in a gesture of utmost respect, but the key focal point is the moment of mutual appreciation shared between the artist and patron. Courbet's elevated status as a figure of great intellect and importance is highlighted by his slight backward tilt of the head and his position standing directly in the unfiltered light.\n\nHowever, at the same time, Courbet's sense of self-importance is also evident in the painting. His beard points towards the patron as if in judgment, while the artist's stick is double the size of Bruyas', alluding to the artist's strength and dominance.",

  "description": "One of the most famous paintings by Thomas Gainsborough is the portrait [i]Mr. and Mrs. Andrews[/i] (1750), which the artist painted when he was only 21 years old. The painting depicts the landowner Robert Andrews and his young wife Frances Andrews sitting on a bench in front of an English countryside landscape. The portrait was commissioned in 1750, two years after the couple married in the parish church of All Saints, Sudbury. However, the painting is not a marriage portrait, instead, it likely celebrated the inheritance Andrews received in 1750. Thus, the painting can be considered a ‘triple’ portrait – of Mr. Andrews, his wife, and his land. \n\nThe couple is dressed casually, their attire is suited for an informal outing. Mr. Andrews is wearing a baggy shooting jacket with bags of powder and shot hanging from his pocket. He is holding a long-barreled shotgun and his dog is at his feet. Mrs. Andrews wears a simple light blue skirt and jacket, and a pair of casual heels. The portrait can be categorized as a ‘conversation piece’, a type of group portrait popular in 18th century England. The conversation piece is a kind of informal portrait: it usually depicts a group of family members or friends in a rural or domestic setting.\n\nIn this early masterpiece, Gainsborough prominently features the naturalistic landscapes, that dominates the right side of the canvas. The artist was particularly fond of landscape painting, and in this case, he used the landscape to display his painterly skills. He creates the effect of changing weather, depicting stormy skies with patches of light and shadow that fall over the fields and meadows. This technique was common in Dutch 17th-century landscape painting, which influenced Gainsborough’s style of painting. This relatively small piece (69.8 cm × 119.4 cm) was typical of Gainsborough’s work in this early period. His later portraits such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/portrait-of-colonel-john-bullock][i]Portrait of Colonel John Bullock[/i][/url] (ca. 1780) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/mrs-richard-brinsley-sheridan-1786][i]Mrs. Richard Brinsley Sheridan[/i][/url] (1785-1787) were much grandeur and painted on larger, close to life-size formats. In these later works, the figure takes center stage, while the landscape in the background becomes more generalized.\n\nIn the painting, Gainsborough left an unpainted patch in Mrs. Andrews's lap. The reason behind this is unknown: some speculate the artist planned to paint a cock pheasant in her lap, which her husband shot while hunting. Others suggest that space was reserved for a baby – the couple, who had nine children in total, had their first child only in 1751. If this was the intention, the portrait would celebrate Mr. Andrew’s authority as a landowner and husband. Mrs. Andrews died in 1780 at age 48, while her husband remarried and died in 1806 at age 80. \n\nThe portrait was largely unknown to the public until it was displayed in an exhibition in Ipswich in 1927. After that, the painting regularly appeared in exhibitions across Britain and abroad. It remained with the family until 1960 when it was sold by Gerald Willoughbury Andrews (a great-great-great-grandson of the sitters). Today, the painting is in the National Gallery, London.",

The Christ in the painting is a direct representation of a crucifix in Pont-Avon, France, where Gaugin visited to paint a number of times. It depicts a yellow form of Christ being crucified in 19th century northern France. French Breton women gather around the cross in prayer. The only shading in the painting is of the women bowed in prayer, the figure of Christ on the cross clearly outlined in black, and his form is flat, typical of the Gaugin’s symbolic style. ",

  "description": "Although many people think of apples as a New England commodity, J. A. Apple Butter Making is actually among a handful of paintings based on Moses' Virginia memories. The house in the picture is the Dudley Place, one of several farms the Moses family occupied as tenants during their years down South.\r\n\r\n\"Late summer was the time for apple butter making,\" Moses wrote in her autobiography. \"The apple butter was considered a necessity.\"\r\n\r\nTo make apple butter, you take two barrels of sweet cider (you grind apples and make sweet cider first), then you put them on in a big brass kettle over afire out in the orchard and start it to boiling. You want three barrels of quartered apples, or snits, as they called them, with cores taken out, and then you commence to feed those in, and stirring and keeping that stirrer going. . . . Womenfolks would keep that going, feeding in all the apples until evening. Then the young folks would come in to start stirring. They'd have two—a boy and a girl—to take hold of the handle. They'd have a regular frolic all night out in the orchard.\r\n\r\nMoses' personal recollections—parts of which read like recipes, others like social history—were mirrored in the content of her painting.",

  "description": "Klee was employed in many successful teaching positions throughout his life, but his stay at the Düsseldorf Academy in Nazi Germany was cut short. In 1933 he was singled out by a Nazi newspaper, which called him out as a Galician Jew. The Gestapo searched his house, and he was quickly fired from his job. Klee created Struck from the List to commemorate this terrible occasion. His sadness at being “stuck from the list” is evident in his monochromatic color scheme, depicting an image that is not entirely abstract, as it clearly resembles a sad faces, tears running down the cheeks.

  "description": "Moses was basically a landscape painter, but certain memories and themes demanded an indoor setting. She herself knew this, and some of her patrons encouraged her to expand her repertoire to include interiors. The subject, however, did not come easily to her.\r\n\r\n\"I tried that interior but did not like it, so I erased it,\" she noted on one occasion. \"That don't seem to be in my line. I like to paint something that leads me on and on into the unknown, something that I want to see away on beyond. Well, maybe I try again.\"\r\n\r\nDespite her difficulties with the subject, Moses did paint a number of striking interiors. Without the landscape to anchor the scene and provide an element of realism, her interiors rely almost wholly on the artist's command of abstract form and patterning. These qualities are used to maximum advantage in The Quilting Bee, wherein the colors and forms of the large quilt and the elaborate table setting play off neatly against the bright clothing of the numerous bustling characters. Still, Moses could not resist adding a bit of nature beyond the tall, uncurtained windows.",

  "description": "Danae was commissioned around 1531 by the Duke of Mantua, Federico Il Gonzaga, as part of a series on the mythical Jupiter’s loves. The painting depicts Danae, the daughter of Acrisius, the king of Argos. According to the legend, Acrisius, hearing from and oracle that Danae’s son would kill him, had his daughter locked in a tower. Jupiter, in the form of a golden rain, came down to Danae and she soon bore a son, Perseus, who eventually killed the king Acrisius. Correggio depicts Jupiter in the form of a golden cloud, floating above the head of Danae, who is being undressed by Eros. ",

  "description": "Victor Vasnetsov’s painting is a free interpretation of the ancient  legend from the times of Kievan Rus of [i]The Journeys of Ilya Muromets[/i]. The artist depicts the hero in a moment of reflection, before a stone inscribed with the following words: “If you go straight ahead, there will be no life; there is no way forward for he who travels past, walks past or flies past.”\n\nVictor Vasnetsov interprets the legend as a real event, depicting the knight in ethnographically and historically authentic armour and in a natural landscape setting. The artist employs literary devices to contrast the forces of lightness and darkness — the lucid figure of the knight on the white horse, the ominous black raven on the stone, the skull and bones scattered across the steppe. The interpretation of the landscape as the endless Russian plain and the loneliness of the thickset rider on the horse lend an epic ring to the picture.",

The painting was a state commission by Charles X to have himself remembered in the building works of the Louvre. The painting depicts an image of Homer, receiving all of the brilliant men of Rome, Greece, and contemporary times. The characters in the painting were extensively researched by Ingres, who studied the paintings of Nicholas Poussin, Raphael, and Apelles, the ancient Greek painter. The painting also includes the figures of Dante, Virgil, and Moliere, the French playwright, along with other figures, including Greek and Roman Gods. ",

  "description": "The Bathers is the largest in a series of nude bather paintings by Cezanne, and is often referred to as the “Large Bathers” or “Big Bathers” to distinguish it from the other bather scenes painted by Cezanne. It is also considered one of the masterpieces of modern art, as well as Cezanne’s finest painting. It was purchased for $100,000 for the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which was criticized for the expenditure, due to the fact that at the time ten percent of Philadelphia’s population was without bathtubs. The nude figures in the painting have been compared to Picasso’s later work Les Desmoiselles d’Avignon, suggesting the influence that Cezanne had on the painters of the period. ",

Correggio signed the agreement to complete the work in 1522, but it was not completed until 1530, eight years later. His time was well spent, as the Assumption is a masterpiece of di sotto in su ceiling painting. Correggio used di sotto in su, the practice of foreshortening the painting in order to make it lengthen the canvas, in an audacious and exemplary fashion. The apostles and the clouds seem to float upward on layers as the figure of Christ descends from the heavens. ",
